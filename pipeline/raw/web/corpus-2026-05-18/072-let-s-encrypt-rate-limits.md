Rate Limits

Last updated: June 12, 2025
See all Documentation

Let’s Encrypt provides rate limits to ensure fair usage by as many
people as possible. We believe these rate limits are high enough to
work for most people by default. We’ve also designed them so that
renewing a certificate almost never hits a rate limit, and so that
large organizations can gradually increase the number of certificates
they can issue without requiring intervention from Let’s Encrypt.

If you’re actively developing or testing a Let’s Encrypt client, please
utilize our staging environment instead of the production API. If
you’re working on integrating Let’s Encrypt as a provider or with a
large website please review our Integration Guide.

How Our Rate Limits Work

Limits are calculated, per request, using a token bucket algorithm.
This approach provides flexibility in how you use your allotted
requests. You can either make requests in bursts—up to the full
limit—or space out your requests to avoid the risk of being limited.

If you’ve hit a rate limit, we don’t have a way to temporarily reset
it. Don’t worry, your capacity for that limit will gradually refill
over time, allowing you to make more requests without any additional
action on your part. Revoking certificates does not reset rate limits,
because the resources used to issue those certificates have already
been consumed. For more information please see Retrying After Hitting
Rate Limits.

Account Registration Limits

The following limits apply when subscribers request a new account using
the new-account API endpoint. Exceeding these limits is very rare. We
recommend that large integrators prefer a design which uses one account
for many customers.

New Registrations per IP Address

Up to 10 accounts can be created from a single IP address every 3
hours. The ability to create new accounts refills at a rate of 1
account every 18 minutes.

Overrides

We do not offer overrides for this limit.

New Registrations per IPv6 Range

Up to 500 accounts can be created from a single /48 IPv6 subnet every 3
hours. The ability to create new accounts refills at a rate of 1
account every 22 seconds.

Overrides

We do not offer overrides for this limit.

Certificate Issuance Limits

The following limits apply when subscribers request a new certificate
using the new-order API endpoint. Exceeding these limits is more
common, especially for large hosting providers or organizations issuing
certificates for many hostnames.

New Orders per Account

Each time you request a certificate from Let’s Encrypt, a new order is
created. A single certificate can include up to 100 identifiers (DNS
names or IP addresses). For performance reasons, it’s better to use
fewer identifiers per certificate whenever you can.

Limit

Up to 300 new orders can be created by a single account every 3 hours.
The ability to create new orders refills at a rate of 1 order every 36
seconds.

Overrides

To exceed this limit, you must request an override for a specific
account.

New Certificates per Registered Domain

A registered domain is, generally speaking, the part of the domain you
purchased from your domain name registrar. For instance, in
www.example.com, the registered domain is example.com. In
new.blog.example.co.uk, the registered domain is example.co.uk. We use
the Public Suffix List to identify registered domains.

If you’re requesting a certificate for an IP address, we also try to
treat the most common allocation (what you’d get from your ISP or
hosting provider) as the “registered domain.” For IPv4 addresses, we
treat the exact address as the registered domain. For IPv6 addresses,
we treat the containing /64 range as the registered domain.

Limit

Up to 50 certificates can be issued per registered domain (or IPv4
address, or IPv6 /64 range) every 7 days. This is a global limit, and
all new order requests, regardless of which account submits them, count
towards this limit. The ability to issue new certificates for the same
registered domain refills at a rate of 1 certificate every 202 minutes.

Overrides

To exceed this limit, you must request an override for the specific
registered domain or an account.

New Certificates per Exact Set of Identifiers

If you request a certificate for 192.168.1.1, example.com and
login.example.com, the “exact set of identifiers” is [192.168.1.1,
example.com, login.example.com]. If you request a certificate for only
1 identifier, such as example.co.uk, then the exact set of identifiers
would be [example.co.uk].

Limit

Up to 5 certificates can be issued per exact same set of identifiers
every 7 days. This is a global limit, and all new order requests,
regardless of which account submits them, count towards this limit. The
ability to request new certificates for the same exact set of
identifiers refills at a rate of 1 certificate every 34 hours.

Common Causes

Reinstalling your client multiple times to troubleshoot an unknown
error, or deleting your ACME client’s configuration data each time you
deploy your application, are common ways to hit this limit. We have
intentionally set this limit relatively low to prevent buggy systems or
software under development from rapidly consuming the capacity of other
rate limits.

When testing or troubleshooting your applications, we recommend
configuring your client to use our staging environment, which has
significantly higher limits.

Workaround

If you’ve hit this limit, you can change the set of identifiers by
adding blog.example.com to request additional certificates. Be aware
that these new orders would not be considered renewals. Therefore, they
would be subject to the New Orders per Account and New Certificates per
Registered Domain rate limits.

Overrides

We do not offer overrides for this limit.

Authorization Failures per Identifier per Account

An authorization is generated for each identifier (DNS name or IP
address) included in an order. Before a certificate can be issued, all
authorizations in the order must be successfully validated. A failed
authorization means that, although the requests for validation were
sent successfully, all of Let’s Encrypt’s attempts to validate control
of the identifier have failed.

Limit

Up to 5 authorization failures per identifier can be incurred by one
account every hour. The ability to incur authorization failures refills
at a rate of 1 per identifier every 12 minutes. Once exceeded, this
limit is enforced by preventing any new orders for the same identifier,
by the same account until the limit resets.

Common Causes

Before you begin troubleshooting, we recommend you set your client to
use our staging environment. This environment has significantly higher
limits, which can help you identify and resolve issues without
consuming your production limits.
* Validation failures when using the HTTP-01 and TLS-ALPN-01 methods
usually stem from network or firewall configurations that prevent
Let’s Encrypt validation servers from reaching your server.
* Validation failures when using the DNS-01 method often result from
missed steps or typos during the initial setup process. Typically,
this validation method requires you to create a CNAME record in
your main DNS zone, enabling your client to set the necessary DNS
records during the validation process.

Overrides

We do not offer overrides for this limit.

Consecutive Authorization Failures per Identifier per Account

Similar to Authorization Failures per Identifier per Account but only
applies to consecutive failures. This limit is designed to prevent
clients from getting stuck forever in a loop of failed validations.

Limit

Up to 1,152 consecutive authorization failures per identifier can be
incurred by one account. The ability to incur authorization failures
refills at a rate of 1 per identifier every day and resets to zero if
an authorization for that identifier is successfully validated. Once
exceeded, the account is prevented from requesting new certificates for
that identifier. Each time the subscriber attempts to request a
certificate they will receive an error containing a link to our
Self-Service Portal where they can unpause issuance for the paused
identifier and up to 49,999 additional paused identifiers associated
with their account.
Failures per Day Time to Pause
1 ∞ (never paused)
2 1,152 days (3.16 years)
5 288 days (9.46 months)
10 128 days (4.21 months)
15 82 days (2.70 months)
20 61 days (1.99 months)
30 40 days
40 30 days
120 10 days

Common Causes

Before you begin troubleshooting, we recommend you set your client to
use our staging environment. This environment has significantly higher
limits, which can help you identify and resolve issues without
consuming your production limits.
* Validation failures when using the HTTP-01 and TLS-ALPN-01 methods
usually stem from network or firewall configurations that prevent
Let’s Encrypt validation servers from reaching your server.
* Validation failures when using the DNS-01 method often result from
missed steps or typos during the initial setup process. Typically,
this validation method requires you to create a CNAME record in
your main DNS zone, enabling your client to set the necessary DNS
records during the validation process.

Overrides

We do not offer overrides for this limit.

Overall Requests Limit

In addition to our account registration and certificate issuance
limits, there are per-endpoint overall request limits that apply per-IP
address. These are enforced by our load balancers and are designed to
protect the ACME API from being overwhelmed by clients that make too
many requests at once.
Endpoint Requests per IP (per second) Burst Capacity
/acme/new-nonce 20 10
/acme/new-account 5 15
/acme/new-order 300 200
/acme/revoke-cert 10 100
/acme/renewal-info 1000 100
/acme/* 250 125
/directory 40 40

Subscribers who exceed these limits will receive a 503 Service
Unavailable HTTP response code. The response will include a Retry-After
header.

Limit Exemptions for Renewals

Let’s Encrypt recognizes a new certificate order as a “renewal” in two
ways: the preferred method is through ACME Renewal Info (ARI), which is
exempt from all rate limits, and the other relies on older renewal
detection logic that considers orders with the exact same set of
identifiers as renewals but may still be subject to certain rate
limits.

ARI Renewals

Renewals coordinated by ARI offer the unique benefit of being exempt
from all rate limits. Clients that support ARI periodically check with
Let’s Encrypt servers to determine if your existing certificate should
be renewed. When the optimal renewal window is reached the client
requests a new order explicitly indicating the certificate it replaces.
If the new order includes at least one identifier matching the
certificate it intends to replace and the certificate has not been
previously replaced using ARI, the order will not be subject to any
rate limits.

Non-ARI Renewals

If your client or hosting provider has yet to add support for ARI, your
order can still be considered a renewal of an earlier certificate if it
contains the exact same set of identifiers, ignoring capitalization and
the order of identifiers. For example, if you requested a certificate
for the identifiers [192.168.1.1, www.example.com, example.com], you
could request four more certificates for [192.168.1.1, www.example.com,
example.com] before hitting the New Certificates per Exact Set of
Identifiers rate limit. Each of these new orders would be considered
renewals and would be exempt from the New Orders per Account and New
Certificates per Registered Domain rate limits. However, unlike ARI
renewals, these orders would still be subject to Authorization Failures
per Identifier per Account and New Certificates per Exact Set of
Identifiers.

Retrying After Hitting Rate Limits

All of our rate limit error messages follow the same format. For
example:
too many new registrations (10) from this IP address in the last 3h0m0s,
retry after 1970-01-01 00:18:15 UTC.

You should be able to successfully make the same request after the
provided date and time. If your request exceeds the capacity of more
than one of our limits, we will always return the error message for the
limit that resets furthest in the future.

Retry-After Header

We include a Retry-After header in all rate limit error responses,
indicating the duration your client should wait before retrying.

You can get a list of certificates issued for your registered domain by
searching crt.sh or Censys, which use the public Certificate
Transparency logs.

Requesting an Override

If you are a large hosting provider or organization working on a Let’s
Encrypt integration, we have a rate limiting form that can be used to
request higher rate limits. It takes a few weeks to process requests,
so this form is not suitable if you just need to reset a rate limit
faster than it resets on its own.
