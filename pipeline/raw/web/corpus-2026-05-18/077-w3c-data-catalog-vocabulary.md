Note

DCAT 3 supersedes DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2], but it does not make it
obsolete. DCAT 3 maintains the DCAT namespace as its terms preserve
backward compatibility with DCAT 2. DCAT 3 relaxes constraints and adds
new classes and properties, but these changes do not break the
definition of previous terms.

Any new implementation is expected to adopt DCAT 3, while the existing
implementations do not need to upgrade to it, unless they want to use
the new features. In particular, current DCAT 2 deployments that do not
overlap with the DCAT 3 new features (e.g., versioning, dataset series
and inverse properties) don't need to change anything to remain in
conformance with DCAT 3.

Abstract

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability
between data catalogs published on the Web. This document defines the
schema and provides examples for its use.

DCAT enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a
catalog using a standard model and vocabulary that facilitates the
consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs. This
can increase the discoverability of datasets and data services. It also
makes it possible to have a decentralized approach to publishing data
catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in
multiple sites possible using the same query mechanism and structure.
Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part of the
digital preservation process.

The namespace for DCAT terms is http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#

The suggested prefix for the DCAT namespace is dcat

Status of This Document

This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision
of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports
index at https://www.w3.org/TR/.

This document defines a major revision of the DCAT 2 vocabulary
([VOCAB-DCAT-2]) in response to use cases, requirements and community
experience which could not be considered during the previous vocabulary
development. This revision extends the DCAT standard in line with
community practice while supporting diverse approaches to data
description and dataset exchange. The main changes to the DCAT
vocabulary have been:
* addition of spdx:checksum property and spdx:Checksum class to
provide digest for DCAT distributions
* addition of properties for supporting versioning, e.g.,
dcat:version, dcat:previousVersion, dcat:hasCurrentVersion, see 11.
Versioning
* addition of a dcat:DatasetSeries class and properties for
representing Dataset Series, see 12. Dataset series

This new version of the vocabulary updates and expands the original but
preserves backward compatibility. A full list of the significant
changes (with links to the relevant GitHub issues) is described in D.
Change history.

Issues, requirements, and features that have been considered and
discussed by the Data eXchange Working Group but have not been
addressed due to lack of maturity or consensus are collected in GitHub.
Those believed to be a priority for a future release are in the
milestone DCAT Future Priority Work.

DCAT history

The original DCAT vocabulary was developed and hosted at the Digital
Enterprise Research Institute (DERI), then refined by the eGov Interest
Group, and finally standardized in 2014 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] by the
Government Linked Data (GLD) Working Group.

A second recommended revision of DCAT, DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2], was
developed by the Dataset Exchange Working Group in response to a new
set of Use Cases and Requirements [DCAT-UCR] gathered from peoples'
experience with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original
version, and new applications that were not considered in the first
version.

This version of DCAT, DCAT 3, was developed by the Dataset Exchange
Working Group, considering some of the more pressing use cases and
requests among those left unaddressed in the previous standardization
round. A summary of the changes from [VOCAB-DCAT-2] is provided in D.
Change history.

External terms

DCAT incorporates terms from pre-existing vocabularies where stable
terms with appropriate meanings could be found, such as foaf:homepage
and dcterms:title. Informal summary definitions of the
externally-defined terms are included in the DCAT vocabulary for
convenience, while authoritative definitions are available in the
normative references. Changes to definitions in the references, if any,
supersede the summaries given in this specification. Note that
conformance to DCAT (4. Conformance) concerns usage of only the terms
in the DCAT vocabulary specification, so possible changes to other
external definitions will not affect the conformance of DCAT
implementations.

Please send comments

The Working Group invited publishers to describe their catalogs and
datasets with the revised version of DCAT described in this document
and to report their implementations following the instruction to
reporting DCAT revised implementations. This information and subsequent
analysis is published in the implementation report.

This document was published by the Dataset Exchange Working Group as a
Recommendation using the Recommendation track.

W3C recommends the wide deployment of this specification as a standard
for the Web.

A W3C Recommendation is a specification that, after extensive
consensus-building, is endorsed by W3C and its Members, and has
commitments from Working Group members to royalty-free licensing for
implementations.

1. Introduction

This section is non-normative.

Sharing data resources among different organizations, researchers,
governments and citizens requires the provision of metadata. This is
irrespective of the data being open or not. DCAT is a vocabulary for
publishing data catalogs on the Web, which was originally developed in
the context of government data catalogs such as data.gov and
data.gov.uk, but it is also applicable and has been used in other
contexts.

DCAT 3 has extended the previous version to support further use cases
and requirements [DCAT-UCR]. These include the possibility of
cataloging other resources in addition to datasets, such as dataset
series. The revision also supports describing versioning of resources.
Guidance on how to use inverse properties is provided.

DCAT provides RDF classes and properties to allow datasets and data
services to be described and included in a catalog. The use of a
standard model and vocabulary facilitates the consumption and
aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs, which can:
1. increase the discoverability of datasets and data services
2. allow federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple
sites

Data described in a catalog can come in many formats, ranging from
spreadsheets, through XML and RDF to various specialized formats. DCAT
does not make any assumptions about these serialization formats of the
datasets but it does distinguish between the abstract dataset and its
different manifestations or distributions.

Data is often provided through a service which supports selection of an
extract, sub-set, or combination of existing data, or of new data
generated by some data processing function. DCAT allows the description
of a data access service to be included in a catalog.

Complementary vocabularies can be used together with DCAT to provide
more detailed format-specific information. For example, properties from
the VoID vocabulary [VOID] can be used within DCAT to express various
statistics about a dataset if that dataset is in RDF format.

This document does not prescribe any particular method of deploying
data catalogs expressed in DCAT. DCAT information can be presented in
many forms including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in
HTML pages as [HTML-RDFa], or serialized as RDF/XML
[RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR], [N3], [Turtle], [JSON-LD] or other formats.
Within this document the examples use [Turtle] because of its
readability.

2. Motivation for change

This section is non-normative.

The original Recommendation [VOCAB-DCAT-1] published in January 2014
provided the basic framework for describing datasets. It made an
important distinction between a dataset as an abstract idea and a
distribution as a manifestation of the dataset. Although DCAT has been
widely adopted, it has become clear that the original specification
lacked a number of essential features that were added either through
the mechanism of a profile, such as the European Commission's DCAT-AP
[DCAT-AP], or the development of larger vocabularies that to a greater
or lesser extent built upon the base standard, such as the Healthcare
and Life Sciences Community Profile [HCLS-Dataset], the Data Tag Suite
[DATS] and more. DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2] was developed to address the
specific shortcomings that have come to light through the experiences
of different communities, the aim being to improve interoperability
between the outputs of these larger vocabularies. For example, DCAT 2
provided classes, properties and guidance to address identifiers,
dataset quality information, and data citation issues.

This revision, DCAT 3, updates the specification throughout.
Significant changes from the 2014 Recommendation and DCAT 2 are marked
within the text using "Note" sections, as well as being described in D.
Change history.

3. Namespaces

The namespace for DCAT is http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#. DCAT also makes
extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, in particular Dublin
Core [DCTERMS]. DCAT defines a minimal set of classes and properties of
its own.

4. Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD in this document are to
be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

A data catalog conforms to DCAT if:
* Access to data is organized into datasets, distributions, data
services and dataset series.
* An RDF description of the catalog itself, the corresponding
cataloged resources, and distributions is available (but the choice
of RDF syntax, access protocol, and access policy are not mandated
by this specification).
* The contents of all metadata fields that are held in the catalog
and that contain data about the catalog itself, the corresponding
cataloged resources, and distributions are included in this RDF
description and are expressed using the appropriate classes and
properties from DCAT, except where no such class or property
exists.
* All classes and properties defined in DCAT are used in a way
consistent with the semantics declared in this specification.

DCAT-compliant catalogs MAY include additional non-DCAT metadata fields
and additional RDF data in the catalog's RDF description.

A DCAT profile is a specification for a data catalog that adds
additional constraints to DCAT. A data catalog that conforms to the
profile also conforms to DCAT. Additional constraints in a profile MAY
include:
* Cardinality constraints, including a minimum set of required
metadata fields
* Sub-classes and sub-properties of the standard DCAT classes and
properties
* Classes and properties for additional metadata fields not covered
in DCAT vocabulary specification
* Controlled vocabularies or IRI sets as acceptable values for
properties
* Requirements for specific access mechanisms (RDF syntaxes,
protocols) to the catalog's RDF description

Note

The notion of profile used in this document denotes metadata
specifications that the Dublin Core community would call application
profiles [DCAP].

5. Vocabulary overview

This section is non-normative.

5.1 DCAT scope

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary for representing data catalogs. DCAT is based
around seven main classes (Figure 1):
* dcat:Catalog represents a catalog, which is a dataset in which each
individual item is a metadata record describing some resource; the
scope of dcat:Catalog is collections of metadata about datasets,
data services, or other resource types.
* dcat:Resource represents a dataset, a data service or any other
resource that may be described by a metadata record in a catalog.
This class is not intended to be used directly, but is the parent
class of dcat:Dataset, dcat:DataService and dcat:Catalog. Resources
in a catalog should be instances of one of these classes, or of a
sub-class of these, or of a sub-class of dcat:Resource defined in a
DCAT profile or other DCAT application. dcat:Resource is actually
an extension point for defining a catalog of any kind of resources.
dcat:Dataset and dcat:DataService can be used for datasets and
services which are not documented in any catalog.
* dcat:Dataset represents a collection of data, published or curated
by a single agent or identifiable community. The notion of dataset
in DCAT is broad and inclusive, with the intention of accommodating
resource types arising from all communities. Data comes in many
forms including numbers, text, pixels, imagery, sound and other
multi-media, and potentially other types, any of which might be
collected into a dataset.
* dcat:Distribution represents an accessible form of a dataset such
as a downloadable file.
* dcat:DataService represents a collection of operations accessible
through an interface (API) that provide access to one or more
datasets or data processing functions.
* dcat:DatasetSeries is a dataset that represents a collection of
datasets that are published separately, but share some
characteristics that group them.
* dcat:CatalogRecord represents a metadata record in the catalog,
primarily concerning the registration information, such as who
added the record and when.

UML model of DCAT classes and properties Figure 1 Overview of DCAT
model, showing the classes of resources that can be members of a
Catalog, and the relationships between them. Except where specifically
indicated, DCAT does not provide cardinality constraints.

Note

Along with the rest of 5. Vocabulary overview, this diagram is
non-normative. Furthermore, while the diagram uses UML-style class
notation it should be interpreted following the usual RDF open-world
assumptions around the presence/absence of properties, relationships,
and their cardinality. The properties shown in each class reflect those
specified in the descriptions of classes in 6. Vocabulary
specification. Open arrow-heads indicate RDFS sub-class-of
relationships (not object-oriented generalization). To assist in
understanding the full scope of each class, available properties are
copied down from each '::super-class'.

A dataset in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or
curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one
or more serializations or formats". A dataset is a conceptual entity,
and can be represented by one or more distributions that serialize the
dataset for transfer. Distributions of a dataset can be provided via
data services.

A data service typically provides selection, extraction, combination,
processing or transformation operations over datasets that might be
hosted locally or remote to the service. The result of any request to a
data service is a representation of a part or all of a dataset or
catalog. A data service might be tied to specific datasets, or its
source data might be configured at request- or run-time. A data
distribution service allows selection and download of a distribution of
a dataset or subset. A data discovery service allows a client to find a
suitable dataset. Other kinds of data service include data
transformation services, such as coordinate transformation services,
re-sampling and interpolation services, and various data processing
services, including simulation and modeling services. Note that a data
service in DCAT is a collection of operations or API which provides
access to data. An interactive user-interface is often available to
provide convenient access to API operations, but its description is
outside the scope of DCAT. The details of a particular data service
endpoint will often be specified through a description conforming to a
standard service type, which complement the scope of the DCAT
vocabulary itself.

Descriptions of datasets and data services can be included in a
catalog. A catalog is a kind of dataset whose member items are
descriptions of datasets and data services. Other types of resources
might also be cataloged, but the scope of DCAT is currently limited to
datasets and data services. To extend the scope of a catalog beyond
datasets and data services it is recommended to define additional
sub-classes of dcat:Resource in a DCAT profile or other DCAT
application. To extend the scope of service descriptions beyond data
distribution services it is recommended to define additional
sub-classes of dcat:DataService in a DCAT profile or other DCAT
application.

Note

The scope of DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] was limited to catalogs of datasets.
A number of use cases for the revision [DCAT-UCR] involve data services
as members of a catalog - see § 5.16 DCAT Distribution to describe Web
services and § 5.18 Modeling service-based data access. Since DCAT 2
[VOCAB-DCAT-2], DCAT includes both datasets and data services to enable
these to be part of a DCAT conformant catalog. Provision for catalogs
to be composed of other catalogs is also made. See Issue #172.

Catalogs of other kinds of things might be designed following the DCAT
pattern, e.g., dealing with facilities, instruments, samples and
specimens, other physical artifacts, events or activities. These are
currently out of scope for DCAT, but might be defined through further
sub-classes of dcat:Resource, which could be specified in a DCAT
profile or other DCAT application.

A catalog record describes an entry in the catalog. Notice that while
dcat:Resource represents the dataset or service itself,
dcat:CatalogRecord is the record that describes the registration of a
resource in the catalog. The use of dcat:CatalogRecord is considered
optional. It is used to capture provenance information about entries in
a catalog explicitly. If this is not necessary then dcat:CatalogRecord
can be safely ignored.

5.2 RDF considerations

The DCAT vocabulary is an OWL2 ontology [OWL2-OVERVIEW] formalized
using [RDF-SCHEMA]. Each class and property in DCAT is denoted by an
IRI [RFC3987]. Locally defined elements are in the namespace
http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#. Elements are also adopted from several
external vocabularies, in particular [FOAF], [DCTERMS] and [PROV-O]

RDF allows resources to have global identifiers (IRIs) or to be blank
nodes. Blank nodes can be used to denote resources without explicitly
naming them with an IRI. They can appear in the subject and object
position of a triple [RDF11-PRIMER]. For example, in many actual DCAT
catalogs, distributions are represented as blank nodes nested inside
the related dataset description. While blank nodes can offer
flexibility for some use cases, in a Linked Data context, blank nodes
limit our ability to collaboratively annotate data. A blank node
resource cannot be the target of a link and it can't be annotated with
new information from new sources. As one of the biggest benefits of the
Linked Data approach is that "anyone can say anything anywhere", use of
blank nodes undermines some of the advantages we can gain from wide
adoption of the RDF model. Even within the closed world of a single
application dataset, use of blank nodes can quickly become limiting
when integrating new data [LinkedDataPatterns]. For these reasons, it
is recommended that instances of the DCAT main classes have a global
identifier, and use of blank nodes is generally discouraged when
encoding DCAT in RDF.

All RDF examples in this document are written in Turtle syntax [Turtle]
and many are available from the DXWG code repository.

Note

Each RDF example in this document is intended to demonstrate specific
capabilities of DCAT, and therefore only shows a subset of all the
potential properties and links which might appear in a complete DCAT
resource.

5.3 Basic example

This example provides a quick overview of how DCAT might be used to
represent a government catalog and its datasets. Titles, labels and
keywords are provided both in English and Spanish to demonstrate the
use of language tags.

First, the catalog description:

Example 1

ex:catalog
a dcat:Catalog ;
dcterms:title "Imaginary Catalog"@en ;
dcterms:title "Catálogo imaginario"@es ;
rdfs:label "Imaginary Catalog"@en ;
rdfs:label "Catálogo imaginario"@es ;
foaf:homepage <http://dcat.example.org/catalog> ;
dcterms:publisher ex:transparency-office ;
dcterms:language <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en> ;
dcat:dataset ex:dataset-001 , ex:dataset-002 , ex:dataset-003 ;
.

The publisher of the catalog has the relative
IRI ex:transparency-office. Further description of the publisher can be
provided as in Example 2:

Example 2

ex:transparency-office
a foaf:Organization ;
rdfs:label "Transparency Office"@en ;
rdfs:label "Oficina de Transparencia"@es ;
.

The catalog lists each of its datasets via the dcat:dataset property.
In Example 1, an example dataset was mentioned with the relative
IRI ex:dataset-001. A possible description of it using DCAT is shown
below:

Example 3

ex:dataset-001
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Imaginary dataset"@en ;
dcterms:title "Conjunto de datos imaginario"@es ;
dcat:keyword "accountability"@en, "transparency"@en, "payments"@en ;
dcat:keyword "responsabilidad"@es, "transparencia"@es, "pagos"@es ;
dcterms:creator ex:finance-employee-001 ;
dcterms:issued "2011-12-05"^^xsd:date ;
dcterms:modified "2011-12-15"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:contactPoint <http://dcat.example.org/transparency-office/contact> ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime ;
dcat:startDate "2011-07-01"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:endDate "2011-09-30"^^xsd:date ;
];
dcat:temporalResolution "P1D"^^xsd:duration ;
dcterms:spatial <http://sws.geonames.org/6695072/> ;
dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters "30.0"^^xsd:decimal ;
dcterms:publisher ex:finance-ministry ;
dcterms:language <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1/en> ;
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity <http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq-W>
;
dcat:distribution ex:dataset-001-csv ;
.

Five distinct temporal descriptors are shown for this dataset. The
dataset publication and revision dates are shown in dcterms:issued and
dcterms:modified. For the frequency of update of the dataset in
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity, we use an instance from the
content-oriented guidelines developed as part of the W3C Data Cube
Vocabulary [VOCAB-DATA-CUBE] efforts. The temporal coverage or extent
is given in dcterms:temporal defining a dcterms:PeriodOfTime as a
closed interval indicated by dcat:startDate and dcat:endDate. The
temporal resolution, which describes the minimum spacing of items
within the dataset, is given in dcat:temporalResolution using the
standard datatype xsd:duration.

Additionally, the spatial coverage or extent is given dcterms:spatial
using an IRI from Geonames. The spatial resolution, which describes the
minimum spatial separation of items within the dataset, is given in
dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters using the standard datatype xsd:decimal.

A contact point is provided where comments and feedback about the
dataset can be sent. Further details about the contact point, such as
email address or telephone number, can be provided using vCard
[VCARD-RDF].

One representation of the dataset ex:dataset-001-csv can be downloaded
as a 5kB CSV file. This is represented as an RDF resource of type
dcat:Distribution.

Example 4

ex:dataset-001-csv
a dcat:Distribution ;
dcat:downloadURL <http://dcat.example.org/files/001.csv> ;
dcterms:title "CSV distribution of imaginary dataset 001"@en ;
dcterms:title "distribución en CSV del conjunto de datos imaginario 001"@es ;
dcat:mediaType <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv> ;
dcat:byteSize "5120"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
.

5.4 Classifying datasets thematically

The catalog classifies its datasets according to a set of domains
represented by the relative IRI ex:themes. SKOS [SKOS-REFERENCE] can be
used to describe the domains used:

Example 5

ex:catalog dcat:themeTaxonomy ex:themes .

ex:themes
a skos:ConceptScheme ;
skos:prefLabel "A set of domains to classify documents"@en ;
.

ex:dataset-001 dcat:theme ex:accountability .

Notice that this dataset is classified under the domain represented by
the relative IRI ex:accountability. It is recommended to define the
concept as part of the concept scheme identified by the IRI ex:themes
that was used to describe the catalog domains. An example SKOS
description:

Example 6

ex:accountability
a skos:Concept ;
skos:inScheme ex:themes ;
skos:prefLabel "Accountability"@en ;
.

5.5 Classifying dataset types

The type or genre of a dataset can be indicated using the dcterms:type
property. It is recommended that the value of the property is taken
from a well governed and broadly recognised set of resource types, such
as the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCTERMS], the MARC Genre/Terms Scheme, the
[ISO-19115-1] MD_Scope codes, the DataCite resource types [DataCite],
or the PARSE.Insight content-types from Re3data [RE3DATA-SCHEMA].

In the following examples, a (notional) dataset is classified
separately using values from different vocabularies.

Example 7

ex:dataset-001
rdf:type dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:type <http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset> ;
.

ex:dataset-001
rdf:type dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/marcgt/dtb> ;
.

It is also possible for multiple classifications to be present in a
single description.

Example 8

ex:dataset-001
rdf:type dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:type <http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Dataset> ;
dcterms:type <http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/marcgt/dtb> ;
dcterms:type <urn:example:datacite/resourceType/Dataset> ;
dcterms:type <urn:example:re3data/contentType/database> ;
.

<urn:example:datacite/resourceType/Dataset>
rdfs:label "Dataset"@en ;
dcterms:source [ rdfs:label "DataCite resource types"@en ] ;
.

<urn:example:re3data/contentType/database>
rdfs:label "Database"@en ;
dcterms:source [ rdfs:label "Re3data content types"@en ] ;
.

5.6 Describing catalog records metadata

If the catalog publisher decides to keep metadata describing its
records (i.e., the records containing metadata describing the
datasets), dcat:CatalogRecord can be used. For example, while
ex:dataset-001 was issued on 2011-12-05, its description on Imaginary
Catalog was added on 2011-12-11. This can be represented by DCAT as in
Example 9:

Example 9

ex:catalog dcat:record ex:record-001 .

ex:record-001
a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
foaf:primaryTopic ex:dataset-001 ;
dcterms:issued "2011-12-11"^^xsd:date ;
.

5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page

ex:dataset-002 is available as a CSV file. However ex:dataset-002 can
only be obtained through some Web page where the user needs to follow
some links, provide some information and check some boxes before
accessing the data.

Example 10

ex:dataset-002
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcat:landingPage <http://dcat.example.org/dataset-002.html> ;
dcat:distribution ex:dataset-002-csv ;
.
ex:dataset-002-csv
a dcat:Distribution ;
dcat:accessURL <http://dcat.example.org/dataset-002.html> ;
dcat:mediaType <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv> ;
.

Notice the use of a dcat:landingPage and the definition of the
dcat:Distribution instance.

5.8 A dataset available as a download and behind some Web page

On the other hand, ex:dataset-003 can be obtained through some landing
page but also can be downloaded from a known URL.

Example 11

ex:dataset-003
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcat:landingPage <http://dcat.example.org/dataset-003.html> ;
dcat:distribution ex:dataset-003-csv ;
.
ex:dataset-003-csv
a dcat:Distribution ;
dcat:downloadURL <http://dcat.example.org/dataset-003.csv> ;
dcat:mediaType <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv> ;
.

Notice that we used dcat:downloadURL with the downloadable distribution
and that the other distribution accessible through the landing page
does not have to be defined as a separate dcat:Distribution instance.

5.9 A dataset available through a service

ex:dataset-004 is distributed in different representations from
different services. The dcat:accessURL for each dcat:Distribution
corresponds with the dcat:endpointURL of the service. Each service is
characterized by its general type using dcterms:type (here using values
from the INSPIRE spatial data service type vocabulary), its specific
API definition using dcterms:conformsTo, with the detailed description
of the individual endpoint parameters and options linked using
dcat:endpointDescription.

Example 12

ex:dataset-004
rdf:type dcat:Dataset ;
dcat:distribution ex:dataset-004-csv ;
dcat:distribution ex:dataset-004-png ;
.

ex:dataset-004-csv
rdf:type dcat:Distribution ;
dcat:accessService ex:table-service-005 ;
dcat:accessURL <http://dcat.example.org/api/table-005> ;
dcat:mediaType <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/csv> ;
.

ex:dataset-004-png
rdf:type dcat:Distribution ;
dcat:accessService ex:figure-service-006 ;
dcat:accessURL <http://dcat.example.org/api/figure-006> ;
dcat:mediaType <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/png> ;
.

ex:figure-service-006
rdf:type dcat:DataService ;
dcterms:conformsTo <http://dcat.example.org/apidef/figure/v1.0> ;
dcterms:type <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServic
eType/view> ;
dcat:endpointDescription <http://dcat.example.org/api/figure-006/params> ;
dcat:endpointURL <http://dcat.example.org/api/figure-006> ;
dcat:servesDataset ex:dataset-004 ;
.

ex:table-service-005
rdf:type dcat:DataService ;
dcterms:conformsTo <http://dcat.example.org/apidef/table/v2.2> ;
dcterms:type <https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServic
eType/download> ;
dcat:endpointDescription <http://dcat.example.org/api/table-005/capability> ;
dcat:endpointURL <http://dcat.example.org/api/table-005> ;
dcat:servesDataset ex:dataset-003, ex:dataset-004 ;
.

6. Vocabulary specification

6.1 RDF representation

Editor's note

New RDF serializations will be made available for DCAT 3 in the
official URIs as soon as DCAT 3 becomes REC. In the meanwhile, the DCAT
3 RDFs are available in the DXWG GitHub repository: dcat3.ttl,
dcat3.rdf, and dcat3.jsonld

The (revised) DCAT vocabulary is available in RDF. The primary artifact
dcat.ttl is a serialization of the core DCAT vocabulary. Alongside it
are a set of other RDF files that provide additional information,
including:
1. The files dcat-external.ttl, dcat-external.rdf, and
dcat-external.jsonld includes externally defined terms where DCAT
has provided additional documentation or usage notes.
2. The files dcat2.ttl, dcat2.rdf, and dcat2.jsonld that correspond to
version 2 of DCAT [VOCAB-DCAT-2].
3. The files dcat2014.ttl and dcat2014.rdf that correspond to the 2014
version of DCAT [VOCAB-DCAT-1].

Note

Where possible, properties defined by DCAT do not have specified
domains in order to leave the property open for use with any kind of
resources. The intention is that such properties can be reused in any
suitable circumstance where they make sense.

6.2 Elements from other vocabularies

DCAT requires use of elements from a number of other vocabularies.
Furthermore, DCAT may be augmented by additional elements from external
vocabularies, following the usual RDFS [RDF-SCHEMA] and OWL2
[OWL2-OVERVIEW] rules and patterns.

6.2.1 Complementary vocabularies

Elements from a number of complementary vocabularies MAY be used
together with DCAT to provide more detailed information. For example:
properties from the VoID vocabulary [VOID] allow the description of
various statistics about a DCAT-described dataset if that dataset is in
RDF format; properties from the Provenance ontology [PROV-O] can be
used to provide more information about the workflow that generated a
dataset or service and related activities and agents; classes and
properties from the Organization Ontology [VOCAB-ORG] can be used to
explain additional details of responsible agents.

6.2.2 Element definitions

The definitions (including domain and range) of terms outside the DCAT
namespace are provided here only for convenience and MUST NOT be
considered normative. The authoritative definitions of these terms are
in the corresponding specifications, i.e., [DC11], [DCTERMS], [FOAF],
[PROV-O], [RDF-SCHEMA], [SKOS-REFERENCE], [XMLSCHEMA11-2] and
[VCARD-RDF].

6.3 Class: Catalog

Note

The scope of dcat:Catalog in DCAT 1 was catalogs of datasets
[VOCAB-DCAT-1]. Since DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2], this was generalized, and
properties common to all cataloged resources were associated with a
super-class dcat:Resource.

Moreover, an explicit class for data services was added in DCAT, to
enable these to be part of a catalog.

Finally, dcat:Catalog was made a sub-class of dcat:Dataset, and
provision for catalogs to be composed of other catalogs is also
enabled.

See Issue #116 and Issue #172.

The following properties are specific to this class:

* catalog record
* resource
* dataset
* service
* catalog
* homepage
* themes

The following properties of the super-class dcat:Dataset are also
available for use:
* distribution
* frequency
* spatial/geographic coverage
* spatial resolution
* temporal coverage
* temporal resolution
* was generated by

The following properties of the super-class dcat:Resource are also
available for use:
* access rights
* conforms to
* contact point
* creator
* description
* has policy
* identifier
* is referenced by
* keyword/tag

* has version
* previous version
* replaces
* status
* version
* version notes
* first
* last
* previous

RDF Class: dcat:Catalog
Definition: A curated collection of metadata about resources.
Sub-class of: dcat:Dataset
Usage note: A Web-based data catalog is typically represented as a
single instance of this class.
Usage note: Datasets and data services are examples of resources in the
context of a data catalog.
See also: 6.5 Class: Catalog Record, 6.6 Class: Dataset

6.3.1 Property: homepage

RDF Property: foaf:homepage
Definition: A homepage of the catalog (a public Web document usually
available in HTML).
Range: foaf:Document
Usage note: foaf:homepage is an inverse functional property (IFP) which
means that it MUST be unique and precisely identify the Web-page for
the resource. This property indicates the canonical Web-page, which
might be helpful in cases where there is more than one Web-page about
the resource.

6.3.2 Property: themes

RDF Property: dcat:themeTaxonomy
Definition: A knowledge organization system (KOS) used to classify the
resources documented in the catalog (e.g., datasets and services).
Domain: dcat:Catalog
Range: rdfs:Resource
Usage note: It is recommended that the taxonomy is organized in a
skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection, owl:Ontology or similar, which
allows each member to be denoted by an IRI and published as Linked
Data.

6.3.3 Property: resource

Note

Property added in this context in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:resource
Definition: A resource that is listed in the catalog.
Sub-property of: dcterms:hasPart
Domain: dcat:Catalog
Range: dcat:Resource
Usage note: This is the most general predicate for membership of a
catalog. Use of a more specific sub-property is recommended when
available.
See also: Sub-properties of dcat:resource in particular dcat:dataset,
dcat:catalog, dcat:service.

6.3.4 Property: dataset

RDF Property: dcat:dataset
Definition: A dataset that is listed in the catalog.

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcat:catalog
Definition: A catalog that is listed in the catalog.
Sub-property of: dcat:resource
Domain: dcat:Catalog
Range: dcat:Catalog

6.3.7 Property: catalog record

RDF Property: dcat:record
Definition: A record describing the registration of a single resource
(e.g., a dataset, a data service) that is part of the catalog.
Domain: dcat:Catalog
Range: dcat:CatalogRecord

6.4 Class: Cataloged Resource

Note

Class added in DCAT 2.

The following properties are specific to this class:
* access rights
* conforms to
* contact point
* creator
* description
* has part
* has policy
* identifier
* is referenced by
* keyword/tag
* landing page
* license
* language
* relation
* rights
* qualified relation

* type/genre
* update/modification date
* qualified attribution
* has current version
* has version
* previous version
* replaces
* status
* version
* version notes
* first
* last
* previous

RDF Class: dcat:Resource
Definition: Resource published or curated by a single agent.
Usage note:

The class of all cataloged resources, the super-class of dcat:Dataset,
dcat:DataService, dcat:Catalog and any other member of a dcat:Catalog.

This class carries properties common to all cataloged resources,
including datasets and data services.

The instances of this class SHOULD be included in a catalog.

When describing a resource which is not a dcat:Dataset or
dcat:DataService, it is recommended to create a suitable sub-class of
dcat:Resource, or use dcat:Resource with the dcterms:type property to
indicate the specific type.
Usage note: dcat:Resource is an extension point that enables the
definition of any kind of catalog. Additional sub-classes may be
defined in a DCAT profile or other DCAT application for catalogs of
other kinds of resources.
See also: 6.5 Class: Catalog Record

6.4.1 Property: access rights

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcterms:accessRights
Definition: Information about who can access the resource or an
indication of its security status.
Range: dcterms:RightsStatement
Usage note: Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided for
the Resource. See also guidance at 9. License and rights statements.
See also: 6.4.20 Property: rights

6.4.2 Property: conforms to

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcterms:conformsTo
Definition: An established standard to which the described resource
conforms.
Range: dcterms:Standard ("A basis for comparison; a reference point
against which other things can be evaluated." [DCTERMS])
Usage note: This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema,
ontology, view or profile that the cataloged resource content conforms
to.

For guidance on the use of this property, see 14.2.1 Conformance to a
standard.

Note

dcterms:Standard is defined in [DCTERMS] as "A basis for comparison; a
reference point against which other things can be evaluated." The
target resource is not restricted to formal standards issued by bodies
like ISO and W3C. In this context, it is any resource that specifies
one or more aspects of the cataloged resource content, for example
schema, semantics, syntax, usage guidelines, file format, or specific
serialization. The meaning of conformance is determined by provisions
in the target standard.

6.4.3 Property: contact point

Note

In DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] the domain of dcat:contactPoint was
dcat:Dataset, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The
domain was relaxed in DCAT 2. See Issue #95.

RDF Property: dcat:contactPoint
Definition: Relevant contact information for the cataloged resource.
Use of vCard is recommended [VCARD-RDF].
Range: vcard:Kind

6.4.4 Property: creator

Note

Property added in DCAT 2, specifically to address data citation
requirements.

RDF Property: dcterms:creator
Definition: The entity responsible for producing the resource.
Range: foaf:Agent
Usage note: Resources of type foaf:Agent are recommended as values for
this property.
See also: 6.12 Class: Organization/Person

Note

This property is added to the dcat:Resource class, as the dcat:Dataset
super-class. For more details, see 13. Data citation.

The use of the [PROV-O] qualified-attribution pattern is described in
15.1 Relationships between datasets and agents. dcterms:creator
corresponds with a general attribution with the role 'creator'.

6.4.5 Property: description

RDF Property: dcterms:description
Definition: A free-text account of the resource.
Range: rdfs:Literal

6.4.6 Property: title

RDF Property: dcterms:title
Definition: A name given to the resource.
Range: rdfs:Literal

6.4.7 Property: release date

RDF Property: dcterms:issued
Definition: Date of formal issuance (e.g., publication) of the
resource.
Range: rdfs:Literal encoded using the relevant ISO 8601 Date and Time
compliant string [DATETIME] and typed using the appropriate XML Schema
datatype [XMLSCHEMA11-2] (xsd:gYear, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:date, or
xsd:dateTime).
Usage note: This property SHOULD be set using the first known date of
issuance.
See also: 6.5.3 Property: listing date and 6.8.3 Property: release date

6.4.8 Property: update/modification date

RDF Property: dcterms:modified
Definition: Most recent date on which the resource was changed, updated
or modified.
Range: rdfs:Literal encoded using the relevant ISO 8601 Date and Time
compliant string [DATETIME] and typed using the appropriate XML Schema
datatype [XMLSCHEMA11-2] (xsd:gYear, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:date, or
xsd:dateTime).
Usage note: The value of this property indicates a change to the actual
resource, not a change to the catalog record. An absent value MAY
indicate that the resource has never changed after its initial
publication, or that the date of last modification is not known, or
that the resource is continuously updated.
See also: 6.6.2 Property: frequency, 6.5.4 Property:
update/modification date and 6.8.4 Property: update/modification date

6.4.9 Property: language

RDF Property: dcterms:language
Definition: A language of the resource. This refers to the natural
language used for textual metadata (i.e., titles, descriptions, etc.)
of a cataloged resource (i.e., dataset or service) or the textual
values of a dataset distribution
Range:

dcterms:LinguisticSystem

Resources defined by the Library of Congress (ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2)
SHOULD be used.

If a ISO 639-1 (two-letter) code is defined for language, then its
corresponding IRI SHOULD be used; if no ISO 639-1 code is defined, then
IRI corresponding to the ISO 639-2 (three-letter) code SHOULD be used.
Usage note: Repeat this property if the resource is available in
multiple languages.
Usage note: The value(s) provided for members of a catalog (i.e.,
dataset or service) override the value(s) provided for the catalog if
they conflict.
Usage note: If representations of a dataset are available for each
language separately, define an instance of dcat:Distribution for each
language and describe the specific language of each distribution using
dcterms:language (i.e., the dataset will have multiple dcterms:language
values and each distribution will have just one as the value of its
dcterms:language property). In case of multilingual distributions, the
distributions will have multiple dcterms:language values.

Note
Requirements for identification of natural language in linked data
specifications are evolving. Many applications use [BCP47] language
tags for this purpose. ISO 639 also provides additional codes in ISO
639-3 which might be required for some uses.

6.4.10 Property: publisher

Note

The use of the [PROV-O] qualified-attribution pattern is described in
15.1 Relationships between datasets and agents. dcterms:publisher
corresponds with a general attribution with the role 'publisher'.

RDF Property: dcterms:publisher
Definition: The entity responsible for making the resource available.
Usage note: Resources of type foaf:Agent are recommended as values for
this property.
See also: 6.12 Class: Organization/Person

6.4.11 Property: identifier

RDF Property: dcterms:identifier
Definition: A unique identifier of the resource being described or
cataloged.
Range: rdfs:Literal
Usage note: The identifier might be used as part of the IRI of the
resource, but still having it represented explicitly is useful.
Usage note: The identifier is a text string which is assigned to the
resource to provide an unambiguous reference within a particular
context.

6.4.12 Property: theme/category

Note

In DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] the domain of dcat:theme was dcat:Dataset,
which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain was
relaxed in DCAT 2. See Issue #123.

DCAT 3 maintains the same expectation as DCAT 2 for the use of the
property dcat:theme. DCAT 3 defines dcat:theme as an OWL object
property and drops its range to make the formalization of the property
more consistent with the expected use. In particular, the change
intends to prevent that each entity used as object of dcat:theme is
automatically inferred as skos:Concept. See issue #1364.

RDF Property: dcat:theme
Type: owl:ObjectProperty
Definition: A main category of the resource. A resource can have
multiple themes.
Sub-property of: dcterms:subject
Usage note: The set of themes used to categorize the resources are
organized in a skos:ConceptScheme, skos:Collection, owl:Ontology or
similar, describing all the categories and their relations in the
catalog.
See also: 6.3.2 Property: themes

6.4.13 Property: type/genre

Note

Property added in DCAT 2. See Issue #64.

RDF Property: dcterms:type
Definition: The nature or genre of the resource.
Sub-property of: dc:type
Range: rdfs:Class
Usage note: The value SHOULD be taken from a well governed and broadly
recognised controlled vocabulary, such as:
1. DCMI Type vocabulary [DCTERMS]
2. [ISO-19115-1] scope codes
3. Datacite resource types [DataCite]
4. PARSE.Insight content-types used by re3data.org [RE3DATA-SCHEMA]
(see item 15 contentType)
5. MARC intellectual resource types

Some members of these controlled vocabularies are not strictly suitable
for datasets or data services (e.g., DCMI Type Event, PhysicalObject;
[ISO-19115-1] CollectionHardware, CollectionSession, Initiative,
Sample, Repository), but might be used in the context of other kinds of
catalogs defined in DCAT profiles or applications.
Usage note: To describe the file format, physical medium, or dimensions
of the resource, use the dcterms:format element.

6.4.14 Property: relation

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcterms:relation
Definition: A resource with an unspecified relationship to the
cataloged resource.
Usage note: dcterms:relation SHOULD be used where the nature of the
relationship between a cataloged resource and related resources is not
known. A more specific sub-property SHOULD be used if the nature of the
relationship of the link is known. The property dcat:distribution
SHOULD be used to link from a dcat:Dataset to a representation of the
dataset, described as a dcat:Distribution
See also: Sub-properties of dcterms:relation in particular
dcat:distribution, dcterms:hasPart, (and its sub-properties
dcat:resource, dcat:catalog, dcat:dataset, dcat:service ),
dcterms:isPartOf, dcterms:conformsTo, dcterms:isFormatOf,
dcterms:hasFormat, dcterms:isVersionOf, dcterms:hasVersion (and its
sub-property dcat:hasVersion ), dcterms:replaces, dcterms:isReplacedBy,
dcterms:references, dcterms:isReferencedBy, dcterms:requires,
dcterms:isRequiredBy

Many existing and legacy catalogs do not distinguish between dataset
components, representations, documentation, schemata and other
resources that are lumped together as part of a dataset.
dcterms:relation is a super-property of a number of more specific
properties which express more precise relationships, so use of
dcterms:relation is not inconsistent with a subsequent reclassification
with more specific semantics, though the more specialized
sub-properties SHOULD be used to link a dataset to component and
supplementary resources if possible.

6.4.15 Property: qualified relation

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcat:qualifiedRelation
Definition: Link to a description of a relationship with another
resource
Sub-property of: prov:qualifiedInfluence
Domain: dcat:Resource
Range: dcat:Relationship
Usage note: Used to link to another resource where the nature of the
relationship is known but does not match one of the standard [DCTERMS]
properties (dcterms:hasPart, dcterms:isPartOf, dcterms:conformsTo,
dcterms:isFormatOf, dcterms:hasFormat, dcterms:isVersionOf,
dcterms:hasVersion, dcterms:replaces, dcterms:isReplacedBy,
dcterms:references, dcterms:isReferencedBy, dcterms:requires,
dcterms:isRequiredBy) or [PROV-O] properties (prov:wasDerivedFrom,
prov:wasInfluencedBy, prov:wasQuotedFrom, prov:wasRevisionOf,
prov:hadPrimarySource, prov:alternateOf, prov:specializationOf).

This DCAT property follows the common qualified relation pattern
described in 15. Qualified relations .

Note

Since this property is a sub-property of prov:qualifiedInfluence, use
of this property on an individual entails that the context resource is
a member of the class prov:Entity [PROV-O] .

6.4.16 Property: keyword/tag

Note

In DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] the domain of dcat:keyword was dcat:Dataset,
which limited use of this property in other contexts. The domain was
relaxed in DCAT 2 - see Issue #121.

RDF Property: dcat:keyword
Definition: A keyword or tag describing the resource.
Range: rdfs:Literal

6.4.17 Property: landing page

Note

In DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] the domain of dcat:landingPage was
dcat:Dataset, which limited use of this property in other contexts. The
domain was relaxed in DCAT 2 - see Issue #122.

RDF Property: dcat:landingPage
Definition: A Web page that can be navigated to in a Web browser to
gain access to the catalog, a dataset, its distributions and/or
additional information.
Sub-property of: foaf:page
Range: foaf:Document
Usage note: If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a
landing page (i.e., direct download URLs are not known), then the
landing page link SHOULD be duplicated as dcat:accessURL on a
distribution. (see 5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page)

6.4.18 Property: qualified attribution

Note

Property added in this context in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: prov:qualifiedAttribution
Definition: Link to an Agent having some form of responsibility for the
resource
Sub-property of: prov:qualifiedInfluence
Domain: prov:Entity
Range: prov:Attribution
Usage note: Used to link to an Agent where the nature of the
relationship is known but does not match one of the standard [DCTERMS]
properties (dcterms:creator, dcterms:publisher). Use dcat:hadRole on
the prov:Attribution to capture the responsibility of the Agent with
respect to the Resource. See 15.1 Relationships between datasets and
agents for usage examples.

This DCAT property follows the common qualified relation pattern
described in 15. Qualified relations .

Note

Use of this property on an individual entails that the context resource
is a member of the class prov:Entity [PROV-O].

6.4.19 Property: license

RDF Property: dcterms:license
Definition: A legal document under which the resource is made
available.
Range: dcterms:LicenseDocument
Usage note: Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided for
the Resource. See also guidance at 9. License and rights statements.

6.4.20 Property: rights

RDF Property: dcterms:rights
Definition: A statement that concerns all rights not addressed with
dcterms:license or dcterms:accessRights, such as copyright statements.
Range: dcterms:RightsStatement
Usage note: Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided for
the Resource. See also guidance at 9. License and rights statements.
See also: 6.4.19 Property: license, 6.8.7 Property: rights, 6.4.1
Property: access rights

6.4.21 Property: has part

Note

Property added in this context in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcterms:hasPart

[ODRL-MODEL] using the ODRL vocabulary [ODRL-VOCAB] MAY be provided for
the resource. See also guidance at 9. License and rights statements.
See also: 6.4.19 Property: license, 6.4.1 Property: access rights,
6.4.20 Property: rights

6.4.23 Property: is referenced by

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcterms:isReferencedBy
Definition: A related resource, such as a publication, that references,
cites, or otherwise points to the cataloged resource.
Usage note: In relation to the use case of data citation, when the
cataloged resource is a dataset, the dcterms:isReferencedBy property
allows to relate the dataset to the resources (such as scholarly
publications) that cite or point to the dataset. Multiple
dcterms:isReferencedBy properties can be used to indicate the dataset
has been referenced by multiple publications, or other resources.
Usage note: This property is used to associate a resource with the
resource (of type dcat:Resource) in question. For other relations to
resources not covered with this property, the more generic property
dcat:qualifiedRelation can be used. See also 15. Qualified relations.

For examples on the use of this property, see C.3 Link datasets and
publications.

6.4.24 Property: previous version

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:previousVersion
Definition: The previous version of a resource in a lineage [PAV].
Equivalent property: pav:previousVersion
Sub-property of: prov:wasRevisionOf
Usage note:

This property is meant to be used to specify a version chain,
consisting of snapshots of a resource.

The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions
resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its
life-cycle. One of the typical cases here is representing the history
of the versions of a dataset that have been released over time.
See also: 6.4.26 Property: current version, 6.4.25 Property: has
version, 6.4.7 Property: release date, 6.4.27 Property: replaces,

For guidance on the use of this property, see 11.1.1 Version chains and
hierarchies.

6.4.25 Property: has version

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:hasVersion
Definition: This resource has a more specific, versioned resource
[PAV].
Equivalent property: pav:hasVersion
Sub-property of: dcterms:hasVersion
Sub-property of: prov:generalizationOf
Usage note:

This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract
resource to several versioned resources, e.g., snapshots [PAV].

The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions
resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its
life-cycle. Therefore, its semantics is more specific than its
super-property dcterms:hasVersion, which makes use of a broader notion
of version, including editions and adaptations.
See also: 6.4.26 Property: current version, 6.4.24 Property: previous
version, 6.4.7 Property: release date, 6.4.27 Property: replaces,

RDF Property: dcat:hasCurrentVersion
Definition: This resource has a more specific, versioned resource with
equivalent content [PAV].
Equivalent property: pav:hasCurrentVersion
Sub-property of: pav:hasVersion
Usage note:

This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract
resource to a single snapshot that can be used as a permalink to
indicate the current version of the content [PAV].

The notion of version used by this property is limited to versions
resulting from revisions occurring to a resource as part of its
life-cycle.

by other ones.

6.4.28 Property: version

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:version
Definition: The version indicator (name or identifier) of a resource.
Equivalent property: pav:version
Range: rdfs:Literal
Usage note:

DCAT does not prescribe how a version name / identifier should be
specified, and refers for guidance to [DWBP]'s Best Practice 7: Provide
a version indicator.

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: adms:versionNotes
Definition: A description of changes between this version and the
previous version of the resource [VOCAB-ADMS].
Range: rdfs:Literal
Usage note:

In case of backward compatibility issues with the previous version of
the resource, a textual description of them SHOULD be specified by
using this property.

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:first
Definition: The first resource in an ordered collection or series of
resources, to which the current resource belongs.
Sub-property of: xhv:first
Usage note:

In DCAT this property is used for resources belonging to a
dcat:DatasetSeries.
See also: 6.4.32 Property: last, 7. Use of inverse properties, 6.4.33
Property: previous.

For guidance on the use of this property, see 12. Dataset series.

6.4.32 Property: last

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:prev
Definition: The previous resource (before the current one) in an
ordered collection or series of resources.
Sub-property of: xhv:prev
Usage note:

In DCAT this property is used for resources belonging to a
dcat:DatasetSeries.

It is important to note that this property is different from
dcat:previousVersion, as it does not denote a previous version of the
same resource, but a distinct resource immediately preceding the
current one in an ordered collection of resources.
See also: 6.4.31 Property: first, 6.4.32 Property: last, 7. Use of
inverse properties.

For guidance on the use of this property, see 12. Dataset series.

6.5 Class: Catalog Record

The following properties are specific to this class
(dcat:CatalogRecord):
* conforms to
* description
* listing date
* primary topic
* title
* update/modification date

RDF Class: dcat:CatalogRecord
Definition: A record in a catalog, describing the registration of a
single dcat:Resource.
Usage note This class is optional and not all catalogs will use it. It
exists for catalogs where a distinction is made between metadata about
a dataset or service and metadata about the entry in the catalog about
the dataset or service. For example, the publication date property of
the dataset reflects the date when the information was originally made
available by the publishing agency, while the publication date of the
catalog record is the date when the dataset was added to the catalog.
In cases where both dates differ, or where only the latter is known,
the publication date SHOULD only be specified for the catalog record.
Notice that the W3C PROV Ontology [PROV-O] allows describing further
provenance information such as the details of the process and the agent
involved in a particular change to a dataset or its registration.
See also 6.6 Class: Dataset

If a catalog is represented as an RDF Dataset with named graphs (as
defined in [SPARQL11-QUERY]), then it is appropriate to place the
description of each dataset (consisting of all RDF triples that mention
the dcat:Dataset, dcat:CatalogRecord, and any of its
dcat:Distributions) into a separate named graph. The name of that graph
SHOULD be the IRI of the catalog record.

6.5.1 Property: title

RDF Property: dcterms:title
Definition: A name given to the record.
Range: rdfs:Literal

6.5.2 Property: description

RDF Property: dcterms:description
Definition: A free-text account of the record.
Range: rdfs:Literal

6.5.3 Property: listing date

RDF Property: dcterms:issued
Definition: The date of listing (i.e., formal recording) of the
corresponding dataset or service in the catalog.
Range: rdfs:Literal encoded using the relevant ISO 8601 Date and Time
compliant string [DATETIME] and typed using the appropriate XML Schema
datatype [XMLSCHEMA11-2] (xsd:gYear, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:date, or
xsd:dateTime).
Usage note: This indicates the date of listing the dataset in the
catalog and not the publication date of the dataset itself.
See also: 6.4.7 Property: release date

6.5.4 Property: update/modification date

RDF Property: dcterms:modified
Definition: Most recent date on which the catalog entry was changed,
updated or modified.
Range: rdfs:Literal encoded using the relevant ISO 8601 Date and Time
compliant string [DATETIME] and typed using the appropriate XML Schema
datatype [XMLSCHEMA11-2] (xsd:gYear, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:date, or
xsd:dateTime).
Usage note: This indicates the date of last change of a catalog entry,
i.e., the catalog metadata description of the dataset, and not the date
of the dataset itself.
See also: 6.4.8 Property: update/modification date

6.5.5 Property: primary topic

RDF Property: foaf:primaryTopic
Definition: The dcat:Resource (dataset or service) described in the
record.
Usage note: foaf:primaryTopic property is functional: each catalog
record can have at most one primary topic, i.e., describes one
cataloged resource.

6.5.6 Property: conforms to

Note

Property added in this context in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcterms:conformsTo
Definition: An established standard to which the described resource
conforms.
Range: dcterms:Standard (A basis for comparison; a reference point
against which other things can be evaluated.)
Usage note: This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema,
ontology, view or profile that the catalog record metadata conforms to.

For guidance on the use of this property, see 14.2.1 Conformance to a
standard.

Note

dcterms:Standard is defined in [DCTERMS] as "A basis for comparison; a
reference point against which other things can be evaluated." The
target resource is not restricted to formal standards issued by bodies
like ISO and W3C. In this context, it is any resource that specifies
one or more aspects of the catalog record content, for example schema,
semantics, syntax, usage guidelines, file format, or specific
serialization. The meaning of conformance is determined by provisions
in the target standard.

6.6 Class: Dataset

Note

In DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] dcat:Dataset was a sub-class of
dctype:Dataset, which is a member of the DCMI Types vocabulary
[DCTERMS]. The scope of dcat:Dataset also includes other members of the
DCMI Types vocabulary, such as various multimedia (imagery, sound,
video) and text, so the sub-class relationship defined in DCAT 1
[VOCAB-DCAT-1] was removed in the DCAT 2 vocabulary - see Issue #98.

Note that members of the DCMI Types vocabulary may appear as the value
of the dcterms:type property, as shown in 5.5 Classifying dataset
types.

The following properties are specific to this class:
* distribution
* frequency
* in series
* spatial/geographic coverage
* spatial resolution
* temporal coverage
* temporal resolution
* was generated by

The following properties of the super-class dcat:Resource are also
available for use:
* access rights
* conforms to
* contact point
* creator
* description
* has policy
* identifier
* is referenced by
* keyword/tag
* landing page
* license
* language
* relation
* rights
* qualified relation
* publisher
* release date
* theme/category
* title
* type/genre
* update/modification date
* qualified attribution
* has current version
* has version
* previous version
* replaces
* status
* version
* version notes
* first
* last
* previous

Information about licenses and rights SHOULD be provided on the level
of Distribution. Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided
for a Dataset in addition to but not instead of the information
provided for the Distributions of that Dataset. Providing license or
rights information for a Dataset that is different from information
provided for a Distribution of that Dataset SHOULD be avoided as this
can create legal conflicts.

RDF Class: dcat:Dataset
Definition: A collection of data, published or curated by a single
agent, and available for access or download in one or more
representations.
Sub-class of: dcat:Resource
Usage note: This class describes the conceptual dataset. One or more
representations might be available, with differing schematic layouts
and formats or serializations.
Usage note: This class describes the actual dataset as published by the
dataset provider. In cases where a distinction between the actual
dataset and its entry in the catalog is necessary (because metadata
such as modification date might differ), the dcat:CatalogRecord class
can be used for the latter.
Usage note: The notion of dataset in DCAT is broad and inclusive, with
the intention of accommodating resource types arising from all
communities. Data comes in many forms including numbers, text, pixels,
imagery, sound and other multi-media, and potentially other types, any
of which might be collected into a dataset.

6.6.1 Property: distribution

RDF Property: dcat:distribution
Definition: An available distribution of the dataset.
Sub-property of: dcterms:relation
Domain: dcat:Dataset
Range: dcat:Distribution

6.6.2 Property: frequency

RDF Property: dcterms:accrualPeriodicity
Definition: The frequency at which a dataset is published.
Range: dcterms:Frequency (A rate at which something recurs)
Usage note: The value of dcterms:accrualPeriodicity gives the rate at
which the dataset-as-a-whole is updated. This may be complemented by
dcat:temporalResolution to give the time between collected data points
in a time series.

Examples showing how dcterms:accrualPeriodicity and
dcat:temporalResolution may be combined are given in 10.1 Temporal
properties.

6.6.3 Property: in series

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: dcat:inSeries
Definition: A dataset series of which the dataset is part.
Range: dcat:DatasetSeries
Sub-property of: dcterms:isPartOf
See also: 7. Use of inverse properties

For guidance on the use of this property, see 12. Dataset series.

6.6.4 Property: spatial/geographical coverage

RDF Property: dcterms:spatial
Definition: The geographical area covered by the dataset.
Range: dcterms:Location (A spatial region or named place)
Usage note: The spatial coverage of a dataset may be encoded as an
instance of dcterms:Location, or may be indicated using an IRI
reference (link) to a resource describing a location. It is recommended
that links are to entries in a well maintained gazetteer such as
Geonames.

Options for expressing the details of a dcterms:Location are provided
in 6.16 Class: Location.

6.6.5 Property: spatial resolution

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters
Definition: Minimum spatial separation resolvable in a dataset,
measured in meters.
Range: rdfs:Literal typed as xsd:decimal
Usage note: If the dataset is an image or grid this should correspond
to the spacing of items. For other kinds of spatial datasets, this
property will usually indicate the smallest distance between items in
the dataset.

The range of this property is a number representing a length in meters.
This is intended to provide a summary indication of the spatial
resolution of the data as a single number. More complex descriptions of
various aspects of spatial precision, accuracy, resolution and other
statistics can be provided using the Data Quality Vocabulary
[VOCAB-DQV].

Note

As for the use of datatype, note that [JSON-LD] converts numbers to
xsd:double or xsd:integer, and properly generating xsd:decimal requires
the use of strings with an explicit or coerced datatype. In [Turtle],
seemingly minor modifications can change the datatype of a value: 100.0
is an xsd:decimal, while 1e2 is an xsd:double.

Note also that number constants without a decimal part (e.g. 42) will,
in [Turtle] or [JSON-LD], produce a literal with datatype xsd:integer.
Since [XMLSCHEMA11-2] defines xsd:integer as a derived type of
xsd:decimal, such literals are semantically valid as values of
dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters. However, syntactic validation tools
such as [SHACL] or [ShEx] consider them as distinct datatypes. Authors
of validation schemas in these languages should therefore consider
adding xsd:integer to the accepted datatypes for
dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters.

6.6.6 Property: temporal coverage

RDF Property: dcterms:temporal
Definition: The temporal period that the dataset covers.
Range: dcterms:PeriodOfTime (An interval of time that is named or
defined by its start and end dates)
Usage note: The temporal coverage of a dataset may be encoded as an
instance of dcterms:PeriodOfTime, or may be indicated using an IRI
reference (link) to a resource describing a time period or interval.

Options for expressing the details of a dcterms:PeriodOfTime are
provided in 6.15 Class: Period of Time.

6.6.7 Property: temporal resolution

Note

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcat:temporalResolution
Definition: Minimum time period resolvable in the dataset.
Range: rdfs:Literal typed as xsd:duration
Usage note: If the dataset is a time-series this should correspond to
the spacing of items in the series. For other kinds of dataset, this
property will usually indicate the smallest time difference between
items in the dataset.

This is intended to provide a summary indication of the temporal
resolution of the data distribution as a single value. More complex
descriptions of various aspects of temporal precision, accuracy,
resolution and other statistics can be provided using the Data Quality
Vocabulary [VOCAB-DQV].

The distinction between dcat:temporalResolution and
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity is illustrated by examples in 10.1 Temporal
properties.

6.6.8 Property: was generated by

Note

Property added in this context in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: prov:wasGeneratedBy
Definition: An activity that generated, or provides the business
context for, the creation of the dataset.
Domain: prov:Entity
Range: prov:Activity An activity is something that occurs over a period
of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming,
processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating
entities.
Usage note: The activity associated with generation of a dataset will
typically be an initiative, project, mission, survey, on-going activity
("business as usual") etc. Multiple prov:wasGeneratedBy properties can
be used to indicate the dataset production context at various levels of
granularity.
Usage note: Use prov:qualifiedGeneration to attach additional details
about the relationship between the dataset and the activity, e.g., the
exact time that the dataset was produced during the lifetime of a
project

Note

Use of this property on an individual entails that the context resource
is a member of the class prov:Entity [PROV-O] .

Details about how to describe the activity that generated a dataset,
such as a project, initiative, on-going activity, mission or survey,
are out of scope for this document. prov:Activity provides for some
basic properties such as begin and end time, associated agents etc.
Further details may be provided through classes defined in
applications. A number of ontologies for describing projects are
available, for example VIVO for academic research projects [VIVO-ISF],
DOAP (Description of a Project) for software projects [DOAP], and
DBPedia for general projects [DBPEDIA-ONT] which are expected to be
suitable for different applications.

RDF Class: dcat:DatasetSeries
Definition: A collection of datasets that are published separately, but
share some characteristics that group them.
Sub-class of: dcat:Dataset
Usage note: Dataset series can be also soft-typed via property
dcterms:type as in the approach used in [GeoDCAT-AP], and adopted in
[DCAT-AP-IT] and [GeoDCAT-AP-IT]).
Usage note: Common scenarios for dataset series include: time series
composed of periodically released subsets; map-series composed of items
of the same type or theme but with differing spatial footprints.

For guidance on the use of this property, see 12. Dataset series.

6.8 Class: Distribution

The following properties are specific to this class:
* access rights
* access URL
* access service
* byte size
* compression format
* conforms to
* description
* download URL
* format
* has policy
* license
* media type
* packaging format

* spatial resolution
* temporal resolution
* title
* update/modification date

RDF Class: dcat:Distribution
Definition: A specific representation of a dataset. A dataset might be
available in multiple serializations that may differ in various ways,
including natural language, media-type or format, schematic
organization, temporal and spatial resolution, level of detail or
profiles (which might specify any or all of the above).
Usage note: This represents a general availability of a dataset. It
implies no information about the actual access method of the data,
i.e., whether by direct download, API, or through a Web page. The use
of dcat:downloadURL property indicates directly downloadable
distributions.
See also: 6.9 Class: Data Service

Note

Examples of distributions include a CSV file, a [netCDF] file, a JSON
document, or a data-cube, files made accessible according to different
profiles, such as XML or JSON schemas or [ShEx] or [SHACL] expressions.

In some cases all distributions of a dataset will be fully
informationally equivalent, in the sense that lossless transformations
between the representations are possible. An example would be different
serializations of an RDF graph using RDF/XML [RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR],
[Turtle], [N3], [JSON-LD]. However, in other cases the distributions
might have different levels of fidelity to the underlying data. For
example, a graphical representation about the data on a CSV file may
not contain the same total information recorded in the CSV file, but
they could be considered as two distributions for the same dataset as
they are about the same data.

As a counter-example, budget data for different years would usually be
modeled as different datasets, each with their own distributions, since
all distributions of one dataset should broadly contain the same data.

Nevertheless, the question of whether different representations can be
understood to be distributions of the same dataset, or distributions of
different datasets, is application specific. Judgment about how to
describe them is the responsibility of the provider, taking into
account their understanding of the expectations of users, and practices
in the relevant community.

Links between a dcat:Distribution and services or Web addresses where
it can be accessed are expressed using dcat:accessURL,
dcat:accessService, dcat:downloadURL, as shown in Figure 1 and
described in the definitions below.

RDF Property: dcterms:license
Definition: A legal document under which the distribution is made
available.
Range: dcterms:LicenseDocument
Usage note: Information about licenses and rights SHOULD be provided on
the level of Distribution. Information about licenses and rights MAY be
provided for a Dataset in addition to but not instead of the
information provided for the Distributions of that Dataset. Providing
license or rights information for a Dataset that is different from
information provided for a Distribution of that Dataset SHOULD be
avoided as this can create legal conflicts. See also guidance at 9.
License and rights statements.
See also: 6.8.7 Property: rights 6.4.19 Property: license

6.8.6 Property: access rights

RDF Property: dcterms:accessRights

dcterms:license, which is a sub-property of dcterms:rights, can be used
to link a distribution to a license document. However, dcterms:rights
allows linking to a rights statement that can include licensing
information as well as other information that supplements the license
such as attribution.

Information about licenses and rights SHOULD be provided on the level
of Distribution. Information about licenses and rights MAY be provided
for a Dataset in addition to but not instead of the information
provided for the Distributions of that Dataset. Providing license or
rights information for a Dataset that is different from information
provided for a Distribution of that Dataset SHOULD be avoided as this
can create legal conflicts. See also guidance at 9. License and rights
statements.

Usage note:

dcat:accessURL SHOULD be used for the URL of a service or location that
can provide access to this distribution, typically through a Web form,
query or API call.

dcat:downloadURL is preferred for direct links to downloadable
resources.

If the distribution(s) are accessible only through a landing page
(i.e., direct download URLs are not known), then the landing page URL
associated with the dcat:Dataset SHOULD be duplicated as access URL on
a distribution (see 5.7 Dataset available only behind some Web page).
See also 6.8.11 Property: download URL, 6.8.10 Property: access service

dcat:accessURL matches the property-chain
dcat:accessService/dcat:endpointURL. In the RDF representation of DCAT
this is axiomatized as an OWL property-chain axiom.

Usage note: The size in bytes can be approximated (as a non-negative
integer) when the precise size is not known.
Usage note: While it is recommended that the size be given as an
integer, alternative literals such as '1.5 MB' are sometimes used.

6.8.13 Property: spatial resolution

Property added in DCAT 2.

RDF Property: dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters
Definition: The minimum spatial separation resolvable in a dataset
distribution, measured in meters.
Range: xsd:decimal or xsd:double

to the spacing of items. For other kinds of spatial datasets, this
property will usually indicate the smallest distance between items in
the dataset.
Usage note: Alternative spatial resolutions might be provided as
different dataset distributions

The range of this property is a number representing a length in meters.
This is intended to provide a summary indication of the spatial
resolution of the data distribution as a single number. More complex
descriptions of various aspects of spatial precision, accuracy,
resolution and other statistics can be provided using the Data Quality

Range: dcterms:Standard (A basis for comparison; a reference point
against which other things can be evaluated.)
Usage note: This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema,
ontology, view or profile that this representation of a dataset
conforms to. This is (generally) a complementary concern to the
media-type or format.
See also: 6.8.17 Property: format, 6.8.16 Property: media type

For guidance on the use of this property, see 14.2.1 Conformance to a
standard.

Note

dcterms:Standard is defined in [DCTERMS] as "A basis for comparison; a
reference point against which other things can be evaluated." It is not
restricted to formal standards issued by bodies like ISO and W3C. In
this context it will usually be used for a schema, ontology, data model
or profile which specifies the structure of a dataset distribution.
This is not necessarily tied to a single encoding or serialization.

6.8.16 Property: media type

Note

The range of dcat:mediaType was tightened from
dcterms:MediaTypeOrExtent to dcterms:MediaType as part of the DCAT 2
vocabulary.

the dcterms:temporal property is a member of the time:TemporalEntity
class from [OWL-TIME]. In this context this could be taken to imply
that dcterms:PeriodOfTime is equivalent to the sub-class
time:ProperInterval

Note

The value of time:hasEnd is a time:Instant for whose position several
options are available. In particular times that do not use the
conventional Gregorian calendar can be expressed, such as geological

algorithms: MD2, MD4, MD5, MD6, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,
SHA-512.

6.17.2 Property: checksum value

Note

Property added in DCAT 3.

RDF Property: spdx:checksumValue
Definition: The checksumValue property provides a lowercase hexadecimal
encoded digest value produced using a specific algorithm [SPDX].
Domain: spdx:Checksum
Range: xsd:hexBinary

7. Use of inverse properties

The properties described in 6. Vocabulary specification do not include
inverses intentionally, with the purpose of ensuring interoperability
also in systems not making use of OWL reasoning.

However, recognizing that inverses are needed for some use cases, DCAT
supports them, but with the requirement that they MAY be used only in
addition to those described in 6. Vocabulary specification, and that
they MUST NOT be used to replace them.

The following table lists the inverse properties supported in DCAT.

Property Inverse
dcat:prev dcat:next
dcat:previousVersion dcat:nextVersion
dcat:distribution dcat:isDistributionOf
dcterms:hasPart dcterms:isPartOf
dcat:resource dcat:inCatalog
dcterms:replaces dcterms:isReplacedBy
dcterms:isReferencedBy dcterms:references
dcat:hasVersion dcat:isVersionOf
dcat:inSeries dcat:seriesMember

prov:wasGeneratedBy prov:generated

8. Dereferenceable identifiers

This section is non-normative.

The scientific and data provider communities use a number of different
identifiers for publications, authors and data. DCAT primarily relies
on persistent HTTP IRIs as an effective way of making identifiers
actionable. Notably, quite a few identifier schemes can be encoded as
dereferenceable HTTP IRIs, and some of them are also returning
machine-readable metadata (e.g., DOIs [ISO-26324] and ORCIDs).
Regardless, data providers still might need to refer to legacy
identifiers, non-HTTP dereferenceable identifiers, locally minted or
third-party-provided identifiers. In these cases, [DCTERMS] and
[VOCAB-ADMS] can be of use.

The property dcterms:identifier explicitly indicates HTTP IRIs as well
as legacy identifiers. In the following examples, dcterms:identifier
identifies a dataset, but it can similarly be used with any kind of
resources.

Example 13

<https://dcat.example.org/id> a dcat:Dataset;
dcterms:identifier "https://dcat.example.org/id"^^xsd:anyURI ;
.

Proxy dereferenceable IRIs can be used when resources do not have HTTP
dereferenceable IDs. For example, in Example 14,
dcat.example.org/proxyid is a proxy for id.

Example 14

<https://dcat.example.org/proxyid> a dcat:Dataset;
dcterms:identifier "id"^^xsd:string ;
.

The property adms:identifier [VOCAB-ADMS] can express other locally
minted identifiers or external identifiers, like DOI, ELI, arΧiv for
creative works and ORCID, VIAF, ISNI for actors such as authors and
publishers, as long as the identifiers are globally unique and stable.

Example 15 uses adms:schemaAgency and dcterms:creator to represent the
authority that defines the identifier scheme (e.g., the DOI foundation
in the example), adms:schemaAgency is used when the authority has no
IRI associated. The CrossRef and DataCite display guidelines recommend
displaying DOIs as full URL link in the form
https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx/.

Example 15

<https://dcat.example.org/id> a dcat:Dataset;
adms:identifier <https://dcat.example.org/iddoi> ;
dcterms:publisher <https://dcat.example.org/PoelenJorritH> ;
.

<https://dcat.example.org/iddoi> a adms:Identifier ;
# reading https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#notations more than one skos:n
otation can be set
skos:notation "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279"^^xsd:anyURI;
# the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has
no IRI
adms:schemaAgency "International DOI Foundation" ;
# the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has
IRI
dcterms:creator ex:InternationalDOIFundation ;
.

ex:InternationalDOIFundation a foaf:Organization ;
rdfs:label "International DOI Foundation" ;
foaf:homepage <https://www.doi.org/> ;
.

<https://dcat.example.org/PoelenJorritH> a foaf:Person;
foaf:name "Jorrit H. Poelen" ;
adms:identifier <https://dcat.example.org/PoelenJorritHID> ;
.

<https://dcat.example.org/PoelenJorritHID> a adms:Identifier;
skos:notation "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-4118"^^xsd:anyURI ;
# the authority/agency defining the identifier scheme, used if the agency has
no IRI
adms:schemaAgency "ORCID" ;
.

Example 15 does not represent the authority responsible for assigning
and maintaining identifiers using that scheme (e.g., Zenodo) as naming
the registrant goes against the philosophy of DOI, where the sub-spaces
are abstracted from the organization that registers them, with the
advantage that DOIs do not change when the organization changes or the
responsibility for that sub-space is handed over to someone else.
Example 15 shows a locally minted identifier for the creator of the
dataset (e.g., https://dcat.example.org/PoelenJorritHID) and its
correspondent ORCID identifier (e.g.,
https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-4118).

When the HTTP dereferenceable ID returns an RDF/OWL description for the
dataset, the use of owl:sameAs might be considered. For example,

Example 16

<https://dcat.example.org/id3> a dcat:Dataset;
...
owl:sameAs <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279> ;
.

when dereferenced with media type text/turtle,
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1486279 returns a [SCHEMA-ORG]
description for the dataset, which might dynamically enrich the
description provided by https://dcat.example.org/id.

Note

Identifiers for datasets should follow the best practices in § 8.7 Data
Identifiers of [DWBP].

The need to distinguish between primary and alternative (or legacy)
identifiers for a dataset within DCAT has been posed as a requirement.
However, it is very much application-specific and would be better
addressed in DCAT profiles rather than mandating a general approach.

Depending on the application context, specific guidelines such as
"DCAT-AP: How to manage duplicates?" can be adopted for distinguishing
authoritative datasets from dataset harvested by third parties
catalogs.

8.1 Indicating common identifier types

If identifiers are not HTTP dereferenceable, common identifier types
can be served as RDF datatypes [RDF11-CONCEPTS] or custom OWL datatypes
[OWL2-SYNTAX] for the sake of interoperability, see ex:type in Example
17.

Example 17

<https://dcat.example.org/id4> a dcat:Dataset;
...
adms:identifier <https://dcat.example.org/sid> .

<https://dcat.example.org/sid5> rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
# the actual id
skos:notation "PA 1-060-815"^^ex:type ;
# Human readable schema agency
adms:schemaAgency "US Copyright Office" ;
dcterms:issued "2001-09-12"^^xsd:date ;
.

If a registered IRI type is used (following [RFC3986], § 3.1 Scheme),
the identifier scheme is part of the IRI; thus indicating a separate
identifier scheme in 'type' is redundant. For example, DOI is
registered as a namespace in the info IRI scheme [IANA-URI-SCHEMES]
(see DOI FAQ #11), so according to [RFC3986], it should be encoded as
in Example 18.

Example 18

<https://dcat.example.org/sid6> rdf:type adms:Identifier ;
# the actual id
skos:notation "info:doi/10.1109/5.771073"^^xsd:anyURI .

Otherwise, examples of common types for identifier scheme (arXiv, etc.)
are defined in DataCite schema [DataCite] and FAIRsharing Registry.

9. License and rights statements

This section is non-normative.

Selecting the right way to express conditions for access to and re-use
of resources can be complex. Implementers should always seek legal
advice before deciding which conditions apply to the resource being
described.

This specification distinguishes three main situations: one where a
statement is associated with a resource that is explicitly declared as
a 'license'; a second, where the statement is associated with a
resource denoting only access rights; a third, covering all the other
cases - i.e., statements not concerning licensing conditions and/or
access rights (e.g., copyright statements).

Note

The provision of licensing conditions and access rights complies with
the Best Practices 4 ("Provide data license information") and 22
("Provide an explanation for data that is not available"),
respectively, from [DWBP].

To address these scenarios, it is recommended to use the property
dcterms:rights, and its sub-properties dcterms:license and
dcterms:accessRights. More precisely:
1. use dcterms:license to refer to licenses;
Note
For interoperability, it is recommended to use canonical IRIs of
well-known licenses such as those defined by Creative Commons.
2. use dcterms:accessRights to express statements concerning only
access rights (e.g., whether data can be accessed by anyone or just
by authorized parties);
Note
Access rights can also be expressed as code lists / taxonomies.
Examples include the access rights code list [EUV-AR] used in
[DCAT-AP] and the Eprints Access Rights Vocabulary Encoding Scheme.
3. use dcterms:rights for all the other types of rights statements -
those which are not covered by dcterms:license and
dcterms:accessRights, such as copyright statements.
Note
A more sophisticated approach to express rights, based on and
extending [DCTERMS], is provided by the Open Data Rights Statement
Vocabulary (ODRS) [ODRS], which defines properties for specifying,
among others, copyright statements and copyright notices.

Example 19: License, access rights, and copyright statement

The following example is about a dataset publicly available (with no
access restriction) and whose distribution is released by using a
standard license - namely, the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0
license. Access rights are specified by using the [EUV-AR] code list.
Property dcterms:rights is used for the copyright statement, which is
specified with a textual description, by using property rdfs:label
(following the Dublin Core™ User Guide).
ex:ds7890 a dcat:Dataset ;
# other dataset properties...
dcterms:accessRights
<http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-right/PUBLIC> ;
dcterms:rights [ a dcterms:RightsStatement ;
rdfs:label "© 2021 ACME Inc."@en
] ;
dcat:distribution [ a dcat:Distribution ;
# other distribution properties...
dcterms:license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>
] ;
.

Finally, in the particular case when rights are expressed via ODRL
policies, it is recommended to use the odrl:hasPolicy property as the
link from the description of the cataloged resource or distribution to
the ODRL policy.

Note

The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language
that provides a flexible and interoperable information model
[ODRL-MODEL], vocabulary [ODRL-VOCAB], and encoding mechanisms for
representing statements about usage (i.e., permissions, prohibitions,
and obligations) of content and services.

Example 20: ODRL policy

This example shows how to use [ODRL-VOCAB] for a dataset with very
specific usage rules. In this case, the data can be read and
derivatives can be created, but no commercial use of the dataset is
allowed. In addition, it is a requirement to register before the
permissions are granted.
ex:ds4242 a dcat:Dataset ;
# other dataset properties...
dcat:distribution [ a dcat:Distribution ;
# other distribution properties...
odrl:hasPolicy [ a odrl:Policy ;
odrl:permission [ a odrl:Permission ;
odrl:action (
<http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/read>
<http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/derive>
)
];
odrl:prohibition [ a odrl:Prohibition ;
odrl:action <http://creativecommons.org/ns#CommercialUse>
] ;
odrl:obligation [ a odrl:Duty ;
odrl:action <https://schema.org/RegisterAction>
];
] ;
] ;
.

The above example does not explicitly define the ODRL Asset, so assumes
the enclosing identified entity is the subject of the policy as per
§ 2.2.3 Target Policy Property in [ODRL-MODEL]. In addition, the
example above follows the ODRL compact policy rules as per § 2.7.1
Compact Policy in [ODRL-MODEL].

10. Time and space

This section is non-normative.

10.1 Temporal properties

Five temporal properties of resources may be described using DCAT.
1. The release time of a resource is given using dcterms:issued. The
value is usually encoded as a xsd:date.
2. The revision or update time of a resource is given using
dcterms:modified. The value is usually encoded as a xsd:date.
3. The update schedule for a resource is indicated using
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity. The value should be taken from a
controlled vocabulary such as Dublin Core Collection Description
Frequency Vocabulary.
4. The minimum temporal separation of items in a dataset is given
using dcat:temporalResolution. The value is encoded as a
xsd:duration. The update schedule and the temporal resolution can
be combined to support the description of different kinds of
time-series data as shown below.
5. The temporal extent of a dataset is given using dcterms:temporal.
The value is a dcterms:PeriodOfTime. A number of options for
expressing the details of a dcterms:PeriodOfTime are recommended in
6.15 Class: Period of Time. Examples of these follow.

Example 21: 15-minute time-series published daily

ex:ds913
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity <http://purl.org/cld/freq/daily> ;
dcat:temporalResolution "PT15M"^^xsd:duration ;
.

Example 22: Hourly data published immediately

ex:ds782
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity <http://purl.org/cld/freq/continuous> ;
dcat:temporalResolution "PT1H"^^xsd:duration ;
.

Example 23: Temporal coverage as closed interval

ex:ds257 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime ;
dcat:startDate "2016-03-04"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:endDate "2018-08-05"^^xsd:date ;
] .

Example 24: Temporal coverage as closed interval, using
time:ProperInterval

The following dataset specification is equivalent to the one in Example
23, but it uses [OWL-TIME]:
ex:ds348 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime , time:ProperInterval ;
time:hasBeginning [ a time:Instant ;
time:inXSDDate "2016-03-04"^^xsd:date ;
] ;
time:hasEnd [ a time:Instant ;
time:inXSDDate "2018-08-05"^^xsd:date ;
] ;
] .

Example 25: Temporal coverage as proper interval using gYear

ex:ds429 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime , time:ProperInterval ;
time:hasBeginning [ a time:Instant ;
time:inXSDgYear "1914"^^xsd:gYear ;
] ;
time:hasEnd [ a time:Instant ;
time:inXSDgYear "1939"^^xsd:gYear ;
] ;
] .

Example 26: Temporal coverage for a geologic dataset

ex:ds850 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime , time:ProperInterval ;
time:hasBeginning [ a time:Instant ;
time:inTimePosition [ a time:TimePosition ;
time:hasTRS <http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicage/ma>
;
time:numericPosition "541.0"^^xsd:decimal ;
] ;
] ;
time:hasEnd [ a time:Instant ;
time:inTimePosition [ a time:TimePosition ;
time:hasTRS <http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicage/ma>
;
time:numericPosition "251.902"^^xsd:decimal ;
] ;
] ;
] .

Example 27: Temporal coverage as open interval (no end date)

ex:ds127 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime ;
dcat:startDate "2016-03-04"^^xsd:date ;
] .

Example 28: Temporal coverage as open interval (no beginning)

ex:ds586 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:temporal [ a dcterms:PeriodOfTime , time:ProperInterval ;
time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDate "2018-08-05"^^xsd:date ] ;
] .

10.2 Spatial properties

Two spatial properties of datasets may be described using DCAT.
1. The minimum spatial separation of items in a dataset is given using
dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters. The value is a decimal number.
An example of the use of dcat:spatialResolutionInMeters is given in
Example 3.
2. The spatial extent of a dataset is given using dcterms:spatial. The
value is a dcterms:Location. A number of options for expressing the
details of a dcterms:Location are recommended in 6.16 Class:
Location.
Examples of these follow.

Note

The following examples are built on the relevant ones included in
[SDW-BP] (in particular, § 12.2.2 Geometries and coordinate reference
systems).

In the examples, for properties locn:geometry, dcat:bbox, and
dcat:centroid, the geometry is always specified with WKT. As per
[GeoSPARQL], when the CRS specification is omitted this implies that
the default CRS is used - namely CRS84 (corresponding to WGS84, but
with axis order longitude/latitude).

For more details on coordinate reference systems and geometry encoding,
we refer the reader to [SDW-BP], and, in particular, to the following
sections:

11. Versioning

This section is non-normative.

The notion of version is often used as a generic term to denote some
kind of relationship between a resource and a derived one. Examples,
among others, include revisions, editions, adaptations, and
translations.

This section focuses specifically on how to use DCAT to describe
versions resulting from a revision - i.e., from changes occurring to a
resource as part of its life-cycle.

For this purpose, DCAT builds upon existing vocabularies, in particular
the versioning component of the [PAV] ontology, and the relevant terms
from [DCTERMS], [OWL2-OVERVIEW], and [VOCAB-ADMS].

It is important to note that versioning can be applied to any of the
first class citizens DCAT resources, including Catalogs, Catalog
Records, Datasets, Distributions.

Note also that the DCAT approach described in the following sections is
meant to be complementary with those already used in specific types of
resources (e.g., [OWL2-OVERVIEW] provides a set of versioning
properties for ontologies), as well as in given domains and
communities. For a comparison between the DCAT versioning approach and
those of other vocabularies, see 11.4 Complementary approaches to
versioning.

Note

The notion of version is very much related to the community practices,
the data management policy and the workflows in place. It is up to data
providers to decide when and why a new version should be released. For
this reason, DCAT refrains from providing definitions or rules about
when changes in a resource should turn into a new release of it, and
refers for guidance to [DWBP] (§ 8.6 Data Versioning and § 8.7 Data
Identifiers).

11.1 Relationships between versions

DCAT supports the following kinds of relationships between versions:
1. Those indicating the version chain and hierarchy (the version
history).
2. Those indicating whether a version is replaced/superseded by
another one.

11.1.1 Version chains and hierarchies

DCAT defines specific properties for describing version history,
aligned with the corresponding [PAV] ones:
* dcat:previousVersion (equivalent to pav:previousVersion)
* dcat:hasVersion (equivalent to pav:hasVersion);
* dcat:hasCurrentVersion (equivalent to pav:hasCurrentVersion, and
subproperty of dcat:hasVersion).

Property dcat:previousVersion is used to build a version chain that can
be navigated backward from a given version to the first one. This
reflects the most typical use case - i.e., linking different versions
published as distinct resources in a catalog.

In addition to this, property dcat:hasVersion can be used to specify a
version hierarchy, by linking an abstract resource to its versions.

If needed, the version hierarchy can be further described by specific
properties. More precisely, property dcat:hasCurrentVersion link an
abstract resource to snapshot corresponding to the current version of
the content, whereas property dcat:isVersionOf (inverse of
dcat:hasVersion) gives the possibility of specifying a back link from a
version to the abstract resource (for the use of this property, see 7.
Use of inverse properties).

Note

On how to use DCAT to specify a resource's status, see 11.3 Resource
life-cycle.

Note that the only properties necessary to specify a version chain and
hierarchy are, respectively, dcat:previousVersion and dcat:hasVersion.
Whether to use or not the other ones depends on the requirements of the
relevant use case.

The following example reuses those in § 8.6 Data Versioning of [DWBP]
and revises them to show how to specify a version chain and hierarchy
on a bus stops dataset, by using the properties described in this
section.

Example 33: Version history of the MyCity bus stops dataset

The MyCity bus stops dataset is updated whenever the list of bus stops
changes. The different versions are preserved in order to keep an
historical record of the bus stops available at given points in time.
An abstract dataset is used to point to the version with the most up to
date list of bus stops.

In Figure 5, the resource with IRI mycity-bus:stops is the abstract
resource, corresponding always to the latest version of the MyCity bus
stops dataset, whereas the other ones correspond to specific versions
of it. The current version is the one with IRI
mycity-bus:stops-2015-12-07.
[version-chain-and-hierarchy.svg] Figure 5 Version chain and hierarchy

mycity-bus:stops-2015-05-05 ,

dcat:isVersionOf mycity-bus:stops ;
.

mycity-bus:stops-2015-12-07 a dcat:Dataset ;
...
dcat:previousVersion mycity-bus:stops-2015-05-05 ;
dcat:isVersionOf mycity-bus:stops ;
.

11.1.2 Versions replaced by other ones

Another type of relationship concerns whether a given version
replaces/supersedes another one. For this purpose, DCAT reuses the
relevant [DCTERMS] property, namely, dcterms:replaces, plus its inverse
dcterms:isReplacedBy, in case a back link needs to be provided.

It is worth noting that these properties are not denoting by themselves
a version chain - i.e., a version is not necessarily replacing its
immediate predecessor.

The following example reuses the description of the MyCity bus stop
dataset in Example 33 to show how replaced versions can be specified in
DCAT.

Example 34: Replaced versions of the MyCity bus stops dataset

mycity-bus:stops-2015-01-01 a dcat:Dataset ;
...

11.2 Version information

Besides the relationships illustrated in the previous section,
versioned resources may be associated with additional information,
describing, e.g., their differences with the original resource (the
version "delta"), the version identifier, and release date.

For these purposes, DCAT makes use of the following properties:
* dcat:version (equivalent to pav:version [PAV]), for the version
name / identifier;
* dcterms:issued [DCTERMS], for the version release date;
* adms:versionNotes [VOCAB-ADMS], for a textual description of the
changes, including backward compatibility issues with the previous
version of the resource.

Note

DCAT does not prescribe how a version name / identifier should be
specified, and refers for guidance to [DWBP]'s Best Practice 7: Provide
a version indicator.

The following example reuses the one in [DWBP]'s Best Practice 7:
Provide a version indicator to show how version information can be
specified in DCAT.

Example 35: First version of the MyCity bus stops dataset

mycity-bus:stops-2015-01-01

dcterms:title "Bus stops of MyCity" ;
...
dcterms:issued "2015-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
...
dcat:version "1.0" ;
adms:versionNotes "First version of the bus stop dataset."@en ;
.

11.3 Resource life-cycle

The life-cycle of a resource is an aspect orthogonal to versioning, and
sometimes strictly related. The evolution of a resource along its
life-cycle (from its conception, to its creation and publication) may
result in new versions, although this is not always the case (e.g., in
case an approval workflow is in place, the resource may not undergo any
change if no revision is needed). Similarly, the creation of a new
version may not necessarily lead to a change in status (e.g., when
changes are not substantial, and/or are implemented on resources still
in development). Moreover, when a resource is replaced because of a
revision (correcting errors, adding new content, etc.), it may be moved
to a different life-cycle status (e.g., deprecation or withdrawal).

It is worth noting that the status of a resource with respect to its
life-cycle is often an important piece of information by itself, from
both the data provider's and data consumers' perspectives. For a data
consumer, it is important to know if a resource is still in development
or not, as well as if it is deprecated or withdrawn (and, in such
cases, if there is a new version to be used). On the other hand, for a
data provider, flagging a resource with its status in the life-cycle is
fundamental for the correct administration of the data management
workflow. E.g., a resource before being published may need to be
stable, and possibly flagged as approved and/or registered. Finally,
besides the actual status of a resource, another useful piece of
information is when the resource moved to a different status (e.g.,
when it was created, reviewed, accepted, published).

As for versioning, the resource life-cycle depends on community
practices, data management policies, and the workflows in place.
Moreover, different resource types (e.g., datasets vs catalog records)
may have different life-cycle statuses.

For the specification of life-cycle statuses, DCAT makes use of
property adms:status [VOCAB-ADMS], along with the appropriate [DCTERMS]
time-related properties (dcterms:created, dcterms:dateSubmitted,
dcterms:dateAccepted, dcterms:dateCopyrighted, dcterms:issued,
dcterms:modified, dcterms:valid). However, DCAT does not prescribe the
use of any specific set of life-cycle statuses, but refers to existing
standards and community practices fit for the relevant application
scenario.

Note

Examples of life-cycle statuses include:
* Those defined in the ISO standard for item registration [ISO-19135]
(accepted / not accepted, deprecated, experimental, reserved,
retired, stable, submitted, superseded, valid / invalid).
* The progress codes defined in [ISO-19115] (accepted, completed,
deprecated, final, historical archive, not accepted, obsolete,
ongoing, pending, planned, proposed, required, retired, superseded,
tentative, under development, valid, withdrawn).
* The ADMS Status vocabulary [ADMS-SKOS], used in [DCAT-AP], which
includes four statuses: completed, deprecated, under development,
and withdrawn.
* The dataset statuses [EUV-DS] and concept statuses [EUV-CS]
vocabularies from the EU Vocabularies registry.

The UK Government Linked Data Registry project [UKGOVLD-REG] provides
an example of how the life-cycle statuses defined in [ISO-19135] can be
used in a registry, along with the criteria for status transition.

11.4 Complementary approaches to versioning

The DCAT versioning approach can coexist with existing versioning
practices - as those used in specific communities, domains, and
resource types.

As an example, the following table shows the correspondences between
the DCAT versioning properties and the vocabularies most frequently
used to specify similar concepts, namely, OWL, for ontologies,
[DCTERMS], and [PROV-O].

CAPTION: Similar (but not equivalent) versioning properties in DCAT,
OWL, [DCTERMS], and [PROV-O]

DCAT OWL [DCTERMS] [PROV-O]
dcat:hasVersion dcterms:hasVersion prov:generalizationOf
dcat:isVersionOf dcterms:isVersionOf prov:specializationOf
dcat:hasCurrentVersion owl:versionIRI
dcat:previousVersion owl:priorVersion prov:wasRevisionOf
dcat:version owl:versionInfo

Note that correspondence does not imply equivalence. These properties
have different scopes and semantics, and therefore they can complement
but not replace each other. In particular, OWL properties are meant to
be used on resources that can be typed as owl:Ontology's, whereas the
[DCTERMS] ones use a very broad notion of version (including editions
and adaptations). On the other hand, DCAT versioning properties are
meant to be used on any resource in a catalog, and they use a very
specific notion of version, as explained in the introduction to 11.
Versioning. Finally, the [PROV-O] property prov:wasRevisionOf, although
semantically similar to dcat:previousVersion, is not explicitly meant
to be used to build a version chain, whereas prov:generalizationOf and
prov:specializationOf are semantically broader than their
sub-properties dcat:hasVersion and dcat:isVersionOf, respectively.

The following example shows how DCAT and OWL can be used
complementarily to versioning [VOCAB-DCAT-2].

Example 36: Use of DCAT and OWL for versioning DCAT 3

12. Dataset series

This section is non-normative.

With "dataset series" we refer to data, somehow interrelated, that are
published separately. An example is budget data split by year and/or
country, instead of being made available in a single dataset.

Dataset series are defined in [ISO-19115] as a "collection of datasets
[…] sharing common characteristics". However, their use is not limited
to geospatial data, although in other domains they can be named
differently (e.g., time series, data slices) and defined more or less
strictly (see, e.g., the notion of "dataset slice" in
[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]).

The reasons and criteria for grouping datasets into series are
manyfold, and they may be related to, e.g., data characteristics,
publishing process, and how they are typically used. For instance, data
huge in size (as geospatial ones) are more easily handled (by data
providers as well as data consumers) by splitting them into smaller
ones. Another example is data released on a yearly basis, which are
typically published as separate datasets, instead of appending the new
data to the first in the series.

As there are no common rules and criteria across domains to decide when
dataset series should be created and how they should be organized, DCAT
does not prescribe any specific approach, and refer for guidance and
domain- and community practices. The purpose of this section is limited
to providing guidance on how dataset series can be specified in DCAT.

12.1 How to specify dataset series

Note
Discussion about using distributions or datasets as members of a
dataset series has taken place in issues issue 868 and issue 1429.

DCAT makes dataset series first class citizens of data catalogs by
minting a new class dcat:DatasetSeries, defined as a subclass of
dcat:Dataset. The datasets are linked to the dataset series by using
the property dcat:inSeries. Note that a dataset series can also be
hierarchical, and a dataset series can be a member of another dataset
series.

Example 37: Yearly budget datasets grouped into a series

In the following example, yearly budget data are grouped into a series.
The series is typed as dcat:DatasetSeries, the child datasets are typed
as dcat:Dataset. The datasets are linked to the series by using
dcat:inSeries.
ex:EUCatalogue a dcat:Catalog ;
dcterms:title "European Data Catalogue"@en ;
dcat:dataset ex:budget , ex:employment , ex:finance ;
.

ex:budget a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
dcterms:title "Budget data"@en ;
.

ex:budget-2018 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2018"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
.

ex:budget-2019 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2019"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
.

ex:budget-2020 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2020"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
.

Dataset series may evolve over time, by acquiring new datasets. E.g., a
dataset series about yearly budget data will acquire a new child
dataset every year. In such cases, it might be important to link the
yearly releases with relationships specifying the first, previous,
next, and latest ones. In such a scenario, DCAT makes use of properties
dcat:first, dcat:prev, and dcat:last, respectively. See 7. Use of
inverse properties for dcat:next.

Example 38: Linking datasets in a series

The following example extends Example 37 by specifying the publication
date (dcterms:issued) of each child dataset, and the previous
(dcat:prev) and next (dcat:next) dataset in the series. Moreover, the
dataset series is linked to its first (dcat:first) and last (dcat:last)
child datasets.
ex:budget a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
dcterms:title "Budget data"@en ;
dcat:first ex:budget-2018 ;
dcat:last ex:budget-2020 ;
.

ex:budget-2018 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2018"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
dcterms:issued "2019-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:next ex:budget-2019 ;
.

ex:budget-2019 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2019"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
dcterms:issued "2020-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:prev ex:budget-2018 ;
dcat:next ex:budget-2020 ;
.

ex:budget-2020 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2020"@en ;
dcat:inSeries ex:budget ;
dcterms:issued "2021-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:prev ex:budget-2019 ;
.

Datasets in a series can, of course, be versioned. In such a case, the
dataset can be linked to its versions by using the approach illustrated
in 11.1.1 Version chains and hierarchies, as shown in Example 39.

Note

This use case was contributed in Issue #1409.

Example 39: Combining dataset series and versions

The following example extends Example 38 by supposing that dataset
ex:budget-2019 has two different versions, namely, ex:budget-2019-rev0
and ex:budget-2019-rev1. Dataset ex:budget-2019 is linked to its
versions by using property dcat:hasVersion, and to its current version
(ex:budget-2019-rev1) by using property dcat:hasCurrentVersion.
ex:budget a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
dcterms:title "Budget data"@en ;
dcat:first ex:budget-2018 ;
dcat:last ex:budget-2020 ;
.

ex:budget-2018 a dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:title "Budget data for year 2018"@en ;

.

dcterms:issued "2021-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
dcat:prev ex:budget-2019 ;
.

12.2 Dataset series metadata

Properties about dataset series can be classified into two groups.

The first group is about properties describing the dataset series
itself. For instance, this is the case of property
dcterms:accrualPeriodicity, whose value should correspond to the
frequency upon which a new child dataset is added.

The second group is about properties reflecting the dimensions
described in child dataset metadata, via upstream inheritance - i.e.,
property values of child datasets are inherited by their parent (the
dataset series).

Typically, this means that, for each of the relevant properties, the
dataset series takes as value the union of those specified in child
datasets. For instance:
* If the temporal coverage of child datasets is a different year,
e.g., 2018, 2019, 2020, the temporal coverage of the series will be
the time period between years 2018 and 2020.
* If child datasets have a different geographic bounding box as
spatial coverage, the spatial coverage of the series will be the
union of these bounding boxes (i.e., a bounding box including the
ones of the child datasets).
* If each child dataset uses a different spatial reference system,
the dataset series will have multiple spatial reference systems.

Finally, some annotation properties of child datasets may need to be
taken into account as well at the level of dataset series. In
particular, properties concerning the creation / publication / update
dates of child datasets may affect the corresponding ones in the
series. For these properties, DCAT recommends the following approach:
* The creation date (dcterms:created) of the dataset series should
correspond to the earliest creation date of the child datasets.
* The publication date (dcterms:issued) of the dataset series should
correspond to the earliest publication date of the child datasets.
* The update date (dcterms:modified) of the dataset series should
correspond to the latest publication or update date of the child
datasets.

Note

To ensure dataset series metadata be correct and updated, mechanisms
can be put in place to implement upstream inheritance automatically.
However, DCAT does not recommend any specific strategy to be adopted.

Example 40: Dataset series metadata

The following example is a variant of Example 38, with child datasets
corresponding to yearly budget data for specific countries. The
temporal resolution (dcat:temporalResolution), temporal coverage
(dcat:temporal), and spatial coverage (dcat:spatial) of the dataset
series correspond to the union of those of the child datasets.
Moreover, the dataset series specifies as publication date the one of
the first published child dataset, whereas the date of publication of
the last child dataset is specified as update date (dcterms:modified).
Finally, the update frequency (dcterms:accrualPeriodicity) of the
dataset series is annual, as the child datasets are published on a
yearly basis.

12.3 Dataset series in existing DCAT implementations

Existing DCAT implementations adopt two main alternative approaches to
specifying dataset series:
1. The dataset series is typed as a dcat:Dataset, whereas its child
datasets are typed as dcat:Distribution's.
2. Both the dataset series and its child datasets are typed as a
dcat:Dataset's, and the two are usually linked by using the
[DCTERMS] properties dcterms:hasPart / dcterms:isPartOf.

In both cases, the dataset series is sometimes soft-typed by using the
[DCTERMS] property dcterms:type (e.g., this is the approach used in
[GeoDCAT-AP], and adopted in [DCAT-AP-IT] and [GeoDCAT-AP-IT]).

These options are not formally incompatible with DCAT, so they can
coexist with dcat:DatasetSeries during the upgrade to DCAT 3.

13. Data citation

This section is non-normative.

Dataset citation is one of the requirements identified. Data citation
is the practice of referencing data in a similar way as when providing
bibliographic references, acknowledging data as a first class output in
any investigative process. Data citation offers multiple benefits, such
as supporting proper attribution and credit to those producing the
data, facilitating data discovery, supporting tracking the impact and
reuse of data, allowing for collaboration and re-use of data, and
enabling the reproducibility of results based on the data.

To support data citation, the dataset description should include at a
minimum: the dataset identifier, the dataset creator(s), the dataset
title, the dataset publisher and the dataset publication or release
date. These elements are those required by the DataCite metadata schema
[DataCite], which is the metadata associated by the persistent
identifiers (Digital Object Identifiers or DOIs) assigned by [DataCite]
to research data.

In order to support data citation, DCAT 2 added the consideration of
dereferenceable identifiers and support for indicating the creators of
the cataloged resources. The remaining properties necessary for data
citation were already available in DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1].

The constraints on the availability of properties required for data
citation in the dataset description can be represented as a DCAT data
citation profile.

14. Quality information

This section is non-normative.

Note

This section is non-normative as it provides guidance on how to
document the quality of DCAT first class entities (e.g., datasets,
distributions) and it does not define new DCAT terms. The guidance
relies on the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [VOCAB-DQV], which is a W3C
Group Note.

The Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) [VOCAB-DQV] offers common modeling
patterns for different aspects of Data Quality. It can relate DCAT
datasets and distributions with different types of quality information
including:
* dqv:QualityAnnotation, which represents feedback and quality
certificates given about the dataset or its distribution.
* dqv:QualityPolicy, which represents a policy or agreement that is
chiefly governed by data quality concerns.
* dqv:QualityMeasurement, which represents a metric value providing
quantitative or qualitative information about the dataset or
distribution.

Each type of quality information can pertain to one or more quality
dimensions, namely, quality characteristics relevant to the consumer.
The practice to see the quality as a multi-dimensional space is
consolidated in the field of quality management to split the quality
management into addressable chunks. DQV does not define a normative
list of quality dimensions. It offers the quality dimensions proposed
in ISO/IEC 25012 [ISO-IEC-25012] and [ZaveriEtAl] as two possible
starting points. It also provides an RDF representation for the quality
dimensions and categories defined in the latter. Ultimately,
implementers will need to choose themselves the collection of quality
dimensions that best fits their needs. The following section shows how
DCAT and DQV can be coupled to describe the quality of datasets and
distributions. For a comprehensive introduction and further examples of
use, please refer to [VOCAB-DQV].

Note

The following examples make no comments on where the quality
information would reside and how it is managed. That is out of scope
for the DCAT vocabulary. The assumption made is that the quality
individuals are available using the IRIs indicated. Besides, the
examples and more in general the [VOCAB-DQV] is neutral to the data
portal design choices on how to collect quality information. For
example, data portals can collect [VOCAB-DQV] instances by implementing
specific UI to annotate data or by taking inputs from 3rd-party
services.

14.1 Providing quality information

A data consumer (ex:consumer1) describes the quality of the dataset
ex:genoaBusStopsDataset that includes a georeferenced list of bus stops
in Genoa. He/she annotates the dataset with a DQV quality note
(ex:genoaBusStopsDatasetCompletenessNote) about data completeness
(ldqd:completeness) to warn that the dataset includes only 20500 out of
the 30000 stops.

Example 41

ex:genoaBusStopsDataset a dcat:Dataset ;
dqv:hasQualityAnnotation ex:genoaBusStopsDatasetCompletenessNote .

ex:genoaBusStopsDatasetCompletenessNote a dqv:UserQualityFeedback ;

rdf:value "Incomplete dataset: it contains only 20500 out of 30000 existing bu
s stops" ;
dc:language "en" ;
dc:format "text/plain"
.

The activity ex:myQualityChecking employs the service
ex:myQualityChecker to check the quality of the ex:genoaBusStopsDataset
dataset. The metric ex:completenessWRTExpectedNumberOfEntities is
applied to measure the dataset completeness (ldqd:completeness) and it
results in the quality measurement
ex:genoaBusStopsDatasetCompletenessMeasurement.

Other examples of quality documentation are available in [VOCAB-DQV],
including examples about how to express dataset accuracy and precision.

14.2 Documenting conformance to standards

This section shows different modeling patterns combining [VOCAB-DQV]
with [PROV-O] and EARL [EARL10-Schema] to represent the conformance
degree to a stated quality standard and the details about the
conformance tests.

14.2.1 Conformance to a standard

The use of dcterms:conformsTo and dcterms:Standard is a well-known
pattern to represent the conformance to a standard. Example 43,
directly borrowed from [SDW-BP] (Example 51), declares a fictitious
dcat:Dataset conformant to the EU INSPIRE Regulation on
interoperability of spatial data sets and services ("Commission
Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive
2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards
interoperability of spatial data sets and services").

Example 43

ex:Dataset-1 a dcat:Dataset;
dcterms:conformsTo <http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/1312/oj> .

# Reference standard / specification
<http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/1312/oj> a dcterms:Standard ;
dcterms:title "Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 imp
lementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as r
egards interoperability of spatial data sets and services"@en ;
dcterms:issued "2010-11-23"^^xsd:date .

Another example concerns the specification of the coordinate reference
system (CRS) used in a dataset - an information which is typically
included in geospatial metadata. Example 44 shows how the CRS of a
dataset can be specified in DCAT:

Example 44

ex:Dataset-2 a dcat:Dataset;
dcterms:conformsTo <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992> .

In Example 44, http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992 is an IRI
from the OGC CRS Registry, corresponding to EPSG:28992 ("Amersfoort /
RD New") (see also Example 30).

Note

The provision of a resource CRS complies with Best Practice 8 (State
how coordinate values are encoded) from [SDW-BP].

In order to ensure interoperability, it is important to consistently
use the IRIs identifying the reference standards / specifications. In
particular, DCAT recommends the following general rules:
* Use IRIs from reference registries, when available. Examples
include the W3C TR registry, the OGC Definitions Server, the ISO
OBP.
* Use the IRI of the standard / specification, and not the namespace
IRI. E.g., to express conformance of a dcat:CatalogRecord with
DCAT, the IRI to be used is https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/, and
not http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#.
* Use the canonical, persistent IRI. This is usually specified in the
document itself. If you are in doubt, use the one included in the
bibliographic citations for that standard / specification.
* Use the non-versioned IRI. If you need to express conformance with
a specific version of the standard / specification, use both the
un-versioned and the versioned IRI. E.g., in case you need to
explicitly state conformance of a dcat:CatalogRecord with DCAT 2,
use both https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/ and
https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/.

Example 45 extends Example 9 to show how to specify that a given
catalog record is conformant with DCAT, by following the above rules.

Example 45

ex:catalog dcat:record ex:record-001 .

ex:record-001
a dcat:CatalogRecord ;
foaf:primaryTopic ex:dataset-001 ;
dcterms:issued "2011-12-11"^^xsd:date ;
dcterms:conformsTo <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/> ;
.

Example 46: IRIs for standards

The following table shows the IRIs of some of the standards used in the
examples included in this document.

14.2.2 Degree of conformance

Some legal context requires to specify the degree of conformance. For
example, INSPIRE metadata adopts a specific controlled vocabulary
[INSPIRE-DoC] to express non-conformance and non-evaluation beside the
full compliance. Similar controlled vocabularies can be defined in
other contexts.

Example 47 specifies some newly minted concepts representing the degree
of conformance (i.e., conformant, not conformant) and declares the
dcterms:type for indicating the result of conformance test. Following a
pattern used in [GeoDCAT-AP], the example uses a prov:Entity to model
the conformance test (e.g., ex:testResult), a prov:Activity to model
the testing activity (e.g., ex:testingActivity), a prov:Plan derived
from the Data on the Web Best Practices [DWBP] (e.g.,
ex:conformanceTest) to check for the whole set of best practices. A
qualified PROV association binds the testing activity to the
conformance test.

Note

Depending on the kind of dataset, other best practices and standards,
such as the FAIR Principles [FAIR] or the Spatial Data on the Web Best
Practices [SDW-BP], can be considered as a replacement or used in
combination with [DWBP].

Example 47

ex:Dataset-3 a dcat:Dataset ;
prov:wasUsedBy ex:testingActivity .

ex:testingActivity a prov:Activity ;
prov:generated ex:testResult ;
prov:qualifiedAssociation [
a prov:Association ;
# http://validator.example.org/ is the agent who ran the test.
prov:agent <http://validator.example.org/>
# following the plan ex:conformanceTest
prov:hadPlan ex:conformanceTest
] .

# Conformance test result
ex:testResult a prov:Entity ;
prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:testingActivity;
# ex:notConformant belongs to a SKOS concept scheme about conformance
dcterms:type ex:notConformant .

ex:conformanceTest a prov:Plan ;
# Here one can specify additional information on the test, which in the exampl
e is derived by the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices
prov:wasDerivedFrom <https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/> .

Also, [VOCAB-DQV] can be deployed to measure the compliance to a
specific standard. In Example 48, the ex:levelOfComplianceToDWBP is a
quality metrics which measures the compliance of a dataset to [DWBP] in
terms of the percentage of passed compliance tests. Example 48 assumes
iso as a namespace prefix representing the quality dimensions and
categories defined in the ISO/IEC 25012 [ISO-IEC-25012].

Example 48

ex:levelOfComplianceToDWBP a dqv:Metric ;
skos:definition "The degree of compliance to DWBP defined as the percentage of
passed compliance tests."@en ;
dqv:expectedDataType xsd:double ;
dqv:inDimension iso:compliance .

iso:compliance a dqv:Dimension ;
skos:prefLabel "Compliance"@en ;
skos:definition "The degree to which data has attributes that adhere to standa
rds, conventions or regulations in force and similar rules relating to data qual
ity in a specific context of use."@en ;
dqv:inCategory iso:inherentAndSystemDependentDataQuality .

iso:inherentAndSystemDependentDataQuality a dqv:Category ;
skos:prefLabel "Inherent and System-Dependent Data Quality"@en .

The quality measurement ex:measurement_complianceToDWBP represents the
level of compliance for dataset ex:Dataset, namely, measurement of the
metric ex:levelOfComplianceToDWBP. If only a part of the compliance
tests succeeds (e.g., half of the compliance tests), the measurement
would look like in Example 49.

Example 49

ex:measurement_complianceToDWBP a dqv:QualityMeasurement ;
dqv:computedOn ex:Dataset ;
dqv:value "50"^^xsd:double ;
sdmx-attribute:unitMeasure <http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/Percenta
ge> ;
dcterms:date "2018-01-10"^^xsd:date ;
dqv:isMeasurementOf ex:levelOfComplianceToDWBP .

14.2.3 Conformance test results

Further information about the tests can be provided using EARL
[EARL10-Schema]. EARL provides specific classes to describe the testing
activity, which can be adopted in conjunction with [PROV-O]. Example 50
describes the Testing activity ex:testingActivity as an earl:Assertion
instead of a qualified association on the prov:Activity. The
earl:Assertion states that dataset ex:Dataset has been tested with the
conformance test ex:conformanceTest, and it has passed the test as
described in ex:testResult.

Example 50

ex:assertion a earl:Assertion ;
earl:subject ex:Dataset ;
earl:test ex:conformanceTest ;
earl:result ex:testResult ;
# let's indicate if the test was manual, automatic, or what ..
earl:mode earl:automatic ;
earl:assertedBy <http://validator.example.org/> ;
prov:wasAttributedTo <http://validator.example.org/> .

ex:conformanceTest a earl:TestRequirement, prov:Plan ;
dcterms:title "Set of conformance test derived from the W3C Data on the Web Be
st Practices"@en ;
# it includes different subtests
dcterms:hasPart ex:testBP1, ex:testBP2, ..., ex:testBP35 ;
#It is derived by the reference standard
prov:wasDerivedFrom <https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/> .

ex:testResult a earl:TestResult ;
# results in conformancy .
dcterms:type ex:conformant ;
prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:testingActivity;
#the overall set of tests have been passed
earl:outcome earl:passed .

# the description of the validator
<http://validator.example.org/> a earl:Assertor, prov:Agent ;
dcterms:description "A test execution service that runs conformance test suite
s."@en ;
dcterms:title "Validator"@en .

#the testing activity
ex:testingActivity a prov:Activity ;
prov:generated ex:assertion, ex:testResult ;
prov:use ex:Dataset ;
prov:wasAssociatedWith <http://validator.example.org/> .

Example 51 shows how the description would have looked like if the
subtest ex:testq1 had failed. In particular, dcterms:description and
earl:info provide additional warnings or error messages in a
human-readable form.

Example 51

ex:assertion1 a earl:Assertion ;
earl:subject ex:Dataset ;
earl:test ex:testq1 ;
earl:result [
a earl:TestResult ;
# results in no conformancy
dcterms:type ex:nonConformant ;
#the overall set of tests have not been passed (!?)
dcterms:date "2015-09-29T11:50:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime ;
# Some XML encoding of the error
dcterms:description """
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<li> test 1 has failed. Some description of the errors found</li>
</ul>"""^^rdf:HTML ;
earl:info """
<test-method duration-ms="47" finished-at="2015-09-29T11:50:00Z"
name="validate" signature="validate()" started-at="2015-09-29T11:50:00Z"
status="FAIL">
<exception class="java.lang.AssertionError">
<message>

</message>
</exception>
</test-method>"""^^rdf:XMLLiteral ;
earl:outcome earl:fail .
];
# we do not know if the test was manual, automatic, or what ..
earl:mode earl:automatic.

Depending on the details required about tests, [VOCAB-DQV] can express
the testing activity and errors as well. In Example 52, ex:error is a
quality annotation that represents the previous error, and
ex:testResult is defined as a dqv:QualityMetadata to collect the above
annotations and the compliance measurements providing provenance
information.

Example 52

ex:errors
a dqv:QualityAnnotation ;
#this annotation is derived by the measurement
prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:testingActivity;
oa:hasTarget ex:Dataset ;
oa:hasBody [
#errors/failed test description
a oa:TextualBody ;
rdf:value """
<test-method duration-ms="47" finished-at="2015-09-29T11:50:00Z"
name="validate" signature="validate()" started-at="2015-09-29T11:50:00Z"
status="FAIL">
<exception class="java.lang.AssertionError">
<message>
Total validation errors found: 2
</message>
</exception>
</test-method>"""^^rdf:XMLLiteral ;
#it can be in any format supported by dc
dc:format "application/xml" ;
] ;
oa:motivatedBy dqv:qualityAssessment , oa:assessing ;
dqv:inDimension iso:compliance ;
.

ex:testResult
a dqv:QualityMetadata ;
# change the the dcterms:type according to the resulted compliance
dcterms:type <http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity
/conformant> ;
prov:wasAttributedTo <http://validator.example.org/> ;
prov:generatedAtTime "2018-05-27T02:52:02Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
prov:wasGeneratedBy ex:testingActivity .

# The graph contains the rest of the statements presented in the previous exampl
es.
# The graph is expressed according to TRIG syntax not TTL (see https://www.w3.or
g/TR/trig/)
ex:testResult {
a dcat:Dataset ;
dqv:hasQualityMeasurement ex:measurement_complianceToDWBP ;
dqv:hasQualityAnnotation ex:errors .
}

#the testing activity
ex:testingActivity a prov:Activity ;
prov:generated ex:testResult ;
prov:use ex:Dataset ;
prov:wasAssociatedWith <http://validator.example.org/> ;
.

Of course, the above modeling patterns can represent any quality tests,
not only conformance to standards.

15. Qualified relations

This section is non-normative.

DCAT includes elements to support description of many aspects of
datasets and data services. Nevertheless, additional information is
required in order to fully express the semantics of some relationships.
An example is that, while [DCTERMS] provides the standard roles
creator, contributor and publisher for attribution of a resource to a
responsible party or agent, there are many other potential roles, see
for example the CI_RoleCode values from [ISO-19115-1]. Similarly, while
[DCTERMS] and [PROV-O] provide some properties to capture relationships
between resources, including was derived from, was quoted from, is
version of, references and several others, many additional concerns are
seen in the list of [ISO-19115-1] DS_AssociationTypeCodes, the IANA
Registry of Link Relations [IANA-RELATIONS], the DataCite metadata
schema [DataCite] and the MARC relators. While these relations could be
captured with additional sub-properties of dcterms:relation,
dcterms:contributor, etc., this would lead to an explosion in the
number of properties, and anyway the full set of potential roles and
relationships is unknown.

A common approach for meeting these kinds of requirements is to
introduce an additional resource to carry parameters that qualify the
relationship. Precedents are the qualified terms in [PROV-O] and the
sample relations in the Semantic Sensor Network ontology [VOCAB-SSN].
The general Qualified Relation pattern is described in
[LinkedDataPatterns].

Many of the qualified terms from [PROV-O] are relevant to the
description of resources in catalogs but these are incomplete due to
the activity-centric viewpoint taken by PROV-O. Addressing some of the
gaps, additional forms are included in the DCAT vocabulary to satisfy
requirements that do not involve explicit activities. These are
summarized in Figure 6:
UML model of DCAT qualified relationships Figure 6 Qualified
relationships support an extensible set of roles relating resources to
agents or to other resources

Note that, while the focus of these qualified forms is to allow for
additional roles on a relationship, other aspect of the relationships,
such as the applicable time interval, are easily attached when a
specific node is used to describe the relationship like this (e.g., see
the chart of Influence relations in [PROV-O] for some examples).

Note

Because of the global domain constraints on prov:qualifiedAttribution
and the super-property of dcat:qualifiedRelation, use of the qualified
forms entail that the context resource is a member of the class
prov:Entity [RDF-SCHEMA].

15.1 Relationships between datasets and agents

The standard [DCTERMS] properties dcterms:contributor, dcterms:creator
and dcterms:publisher, and the generic prov:wasAttributedTo from
[PROV-O], support basic associations of responsible agents with a
cataloged resource. However, there are many other roles of importance
in relation to datasets and services - e.g., funder, distributor,
custodian, editor. Some of these roles are enumerated in the
CI_RoleCode values from [ISO-19115-1], in the [DataCite] metadata
schema, and included within the MARC relators.

A general method for assigning an agent to a resource with a specified
role is provided by using the qualified form prov:qualifiedAttribution
from [PROV-O]. Example 53 provides an illustration:

Example 53

ex:DS987
a dcat:Dataset ;
prov:qualifiedAttribution [
a prov:Attribution ;
prov:agent <https://www.ala.org.au/> ;
dcat:hadRole <urn:example:isotc211/CI_RoleCode/distributor>
] ;
prov:qualifiedAttribution [
a prov:Attribution ;
prov:agent <https://www.education.gov.au/> ;
dcat:hadRole <urn:example:isotc211/CI_RoleCode/funder>
] ;
.

In Example 53 the roles are denoted by IRIs from a non-normative,
non-dereferenceable representation of the CI_RoleCode codelist from
[ISO-19115-1] (e.g., URN like urn:example:isotc211/CI_RoleCode). Linked
data dereferenceable and normative representations should be preferred
when available.

Note

The domain of prov:hadRole property is prov:Association, i.e., [PROV-O]
roles relate to activities, not entities [PROV-O]. Therefore, a new
property dcat:hadRole is used to attach a specific role to the
association-class prov:Attribution.

15.2 Relationships between datasets and other resources

The standard [DCTERMS] properties dcterms:relation and sub-properties
such as dcterms:hasPart / dcterms:isPartOf, dcterms:hasVersion /
dcterms:isVersionOf, dcterms:replaces / dcterms:isReplacedBy,
dcterms:requires / dcterms:isRequiredBy, prov:wasDerivedFrom,
prov:wasQuotedFrom, support the description of relationships between
datasets and other cataloged resources. However, there are many other
relationships of importance - e.g., alternate, canonical, original,
preview, stereo-mate, working-copy-of. Some of these roles are
enumerated in the DS_AssociationTypeCodes values from [ISO-19115-1],
the IANA Registry of Link Relations [IANA-RELATIONS], in the [DataCite]
metadata schema, and included within the MARC relators.

A general method for relating a resource to another resource with a
specified role is provided by using the qualified form
dcat:qualifiedRelation. Example 54 provides illustrations:

Example 54

ex:Test987
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcat:qualifiedRelation [
a dcat:Relationship ;
dcterms:relation <http://dcat.example.org/Original987> ;
dcat:hadRole <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/original>
] ;
.

ex:Test543L
a dcat:Dataset ;
dcat:qualifiedRelation [
a dcat:Relationship ;
dcterms:relation <http://dcat.example.org/Test543R> ;
dcat:hadRole <urn:example:isotc211/DS_AssociationTypeCode/stereoMate>
] ;
.

In Example 54 the roles are denoted by IRIs from [IANA-RELATIONS] and
from a (non-normative) linked data representation of the
DS_AssociationTypeCode codelist from [ISO-19115-1].

Note

The property dcat:qualifiedRelation and association-class
dcat:Relationship follow the pattern established in W3C [PROV-O] and
described in § 3.3 Qualified Terms. However, [PROV-O] is
activity-centric, and does not support Entity-Entity relations except
for the single case of 'was derived from', thus necessitating the new
elements shown here to support the general case.

16. DCAT Profiles

This section is non-normative.

The DCAT-2014 vocabulary [VOCAB-DCAT-1] and DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2] have
been extended for application in data catalogs in different domains.
Each of these new specifications constitutes a DCAT profile, i.e., a
named set of constraints based on DCAT (see 4. Conformance). In some
cases, a profile extends one of the DCAT profiles themselves, by adding
classes and properties for metadata fields not covered in the reference
DCAT profile.

Some of the DCAT profiles are:
* DCAT-AP [DCAT-AP]: The DCAT application profile for data portals in
Europe
* GeoDCAT-AP [GeoDCAT-AP]: Geospatial profile of [DCAT-AP]
* StatDCAT-AP [StatDCAT-AP]: Statistical profile of [DCAT-AP]
* DCAT-AP_IT [DCAT-AP-IT]: Italian profile of [DCAT-AP]
* GeoDCAT-AP_IT [GeoDCAT-AP-IT]: Italian profile of [GeoDCAT-AP]
* DCAT-AP-NO [DCAT-AP-NO]: Norwegian profile of [DCAT-AP]
* DCAT-AP.de [DCAT-AP.de]: German profile of [DCAT-AP]
* DCAT-BE [DCAT-BE]: Belgian profile of [DCAT-AP]
* DCAT-AP-SE [DCAT-AP-SE]: Swedish profile of [DCAT-AP]

17. Security and Privacy Considerations

The DCAT vocabulary supports datasets that may contain personal or
private information. In addition, the metadata expressed with DCAT may
itself contain personal or private information, such as resource
creators, publishers, and other parties or agents described via
qualified relations. Implementers who produce, maintain, publish or
consume such vocabulary terms must take steps to ensure security and
privacy considerations are addressed. Sensitive data and metadata must
be stored securely and made available only to authorized parties, in
accordance with the legal and functional requirements of the type of
data involved. Detailing how to secure web content and authenticate
users is beyond the scope of DCAT.

Some datasets require assurances of integrity and authenticity (for
example, data about software vulnerabilities). For these, checksums can
serve as a type of verification. DCAT borrows the spdx:Checksum class
from [SPDX] to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DCAT
distributions. Publishers may provide a checksum value (a hash) and the
algorithm used to generate the hash for each resource in the
distribution. A checksum must, however, be provided via a route that is
separate from the data it sums. It may be included in metadata that is
provided with the data (e.g., a tarfile that includes a file for the
distribution and a file for the metadata that includes a checksum for
the distribution file), but if so the checksum, or a checksum for the
metadata, must also be provided separately to foil an attacker who
would manipulate the checksum along with the data. A checksum provided
in DCAT metadata will not provide the expected assurances if the
integrity and authenticity of the metadata are not also guaranteed.

Integrity and authenticity of DCAT data ultimately depend on the
trustworthiness of the source. DCAT providers should address integrity
and authenticity at the application level and transport level. For
example, they should ensure the integrity and authenticity of their API
and download endpoints, make DCAT data and metadata files downloadable
from authoritative HTTPS origins, and provide any checksums via a
separate channel from the data they represent.

18. Accessibility Considerations

The DCAT vocabulary provides a model for describing data catalogs. The
nature of data in the catalogs depends on the specific domains of
application and might include non-text data. When possible, it is
important to enforce alternative text for non-text data resources
through the DCAT profile mechanisms or systems supporting the creation
and editing of such data to improve the accessibility to data. The
practice to provide text alternatives for any non-text content, which
can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print,
braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language complies with
accessibility guidelines included in [UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20].

B. Alignment with Schema.org

This section is non-normative.

Note

See the issues on Alignments and Crosswalks for more discussion.

Schema.org [SCHEMA-ORG] includes a number of types and properties based
on the original DCAT work (see sdo:Dataset as a starting point), and
the index for Google's Dataset Search service relies on structured
description in Web pages about datasets using both schema.org and DCAT.
A comparison of the DCAT backbone, shown in Figure 1 above with the
related classes from [SCHEMA-ORG] in Figure 7 shows the similarity, in
particular: .
* the distinction between (abstract) Dataset and (concrete)
DataDownload matches dcat:Dataset / dcat:Distribution
* the relationship of Datasets to DataCatalogs

UML model of schema.org classes and properties related to dataset
catalogs Figure 7 schema.org support for dataset catalogs, showing a
selection of schema.org properties related to the classes shown

General purpose Web search services that use metadata at all rely
primarily on [SCHEMA-ORG], so the relationship of DCAT to [SCHEMA-ORG]
is of interest for data providers and catalog publishers who wish their
datasets and services to be exposed through those indexes.

A mapping between DCAT 1 and schema.org was discussed on the original
proposal to extend [SCHEMA-ORG] for describing datasets and data
catalogs. Partial mappings between DCAT 1 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] and
[SCHEMA-ORG] were provided earlier by the Spatial Data on the Web
Working Group, building upon previous work.

A recommended mapping from the revised DCAT (this document) to
[SCHEMA-ORG] version 3.4 is available in an RDF file. This mapping is
axiomatized using the predicates rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf,
owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, skos:closeMatch, and also
using the annotation properties sdo:domainIncludes and
sdo:rangeIncludes to match [SCHEMA-ORG] semantics. The alignment is
summarized in the table below, considering the prefix sdo as
http://schema.org/.

C. Examples

This section is non-normative.

C.1 Loosely structured catalog

Note

The background to this example is discussed in Issue #253 ("Best
practice for a loosely-structured catalog").

In many legacy catalogs and repositories (e.g., CKAN), ‘datasets’ are
‘just a bag of files’. There is no distinction made between
distribution (representation), and other kinds of relationship (e.g.,
documentation, schema, supporting documents) from the dataset to each
of the files.

If the nature of the relationships between a dataset and component
resources in a catalog, repository, or elsewhere are not known,
dcterms:relation or its sub-property dcterms:hasPart can be used:

Example 55

ex:d33937
dcterms:description "A set of RDF graphs representing the International [Chron

If the nature of the relationship is known, then other sub-properties
of dcterms:relation should be used to convey this. In particular, if it
is clear that any of these related resources is a proper representation
of the dataset, then dcat:distribution should be used.

C.2 Dataset provenance

The provenance or business context of a dataset can be described using
elements from the W3C Provenance Ontology [PROV-O].

For example, a simple link from a dataset description to the project
that generated the dataset can be formalized as follows (other details
elided for clarity):

Example 58

dap:atnf-P366-2003SEPT
rdf:type dcat:Dataset ;
dcterms:bibliographicCitation "Burgay, M; McLaughlin, M; Kramer, M; Lyne, A; J
oshi, B; Pearce, G; D'Amico, N; Possenti, A; Manchester, R; Camilo, F (2017): Pa
rkes observations for project P366 semester 2003SEPT. v1. CSIRO. Data Collection
. https://doi.org/10.4225/08/598dc08d07bb7" ;
dcterms:title "Parkes observations for project P366 semester 2003SEPT"@en ;
dcat:landingPage <https://data.csiro.au/dap/landingpage?pid=csiro:P366-2003SEP
T> ;
prov:wasGeneratedBy dap:P366 ;
.

dap:P366
rdf:type prov:Activity ;
dcterms:type <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Observation> ;
prov:startedAtTime "2000-11-01"^^xsd:date ;
prov:used dap:Parkes-radio-telescope ;
prov:wasInformedBy dap:ATNF ;
rdfs:label "P366 - Parkes multibeam high-latitude pulsar survey"@en ;
rdfs:seeAlso <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10100.x> ;
.

This example is available from the DXWG DCAT 3 code repository at
csiro-dap-examples.ttl.

Several properties capture provenance information, including within the
citation and title, but the primary link to a formal description of the
project is through prov:wasGeneratedBy. A terse description of the
project is shown as a prov:Activity, though this would not necessarily
be part of the same catalog. Note that as the project is ongoing, the
activity has no end date.

Further provenance information might be provided using the other
starting point properties from PROV, in particular prov:wasAttributedTo
(to link to an agent associated with the dataset production) and
prov:wasDerivedFrom (to link to a predecessor dataset). Both of these
complement Dublin Core properties already used in DCAT, as follows:
* prov:wasAttributedTo provides a general link to all kinds of
associated agents, such as project sponsors, managers, dataset
owners, etc., which are not correctly characterized using
dcterms:creator, dcterms:contributor or dcterms:publisher.
* prov:wasDerivedFrom supports a more specific relationship to an
input or predecessor dataset compared with dcterms:source, which is
not necessarily a previous dataset.

Further patterns for the use of qualified properties for resource
attribution and interrelationships are described in 15. Qualified
relations.

C.3 Link datasets and publications

Datasets are often associated with publications (scholarly articles,
reports, etc.) and DCAT relies on the property dcterms:isReferencedBy
to provide a way to link publications about a dataset to the dataset

The following example shows how a dataset published in the Dryad
repository is linked to a publication available in the Nature
Scientific Data journal:

Example 59

ex:globtherm
dcterms:title "Data from: GlobTherm, a global database on thermal tolerances f
or aquatic and terrestrial organisms"@en ;
dcterms:description "How climate affects species distributions is a longstandi
ng question receiving renewed interest owing to the need to predict the impacts
of global warming on biodiversity. Is climate change forcing species to live nea
r their critical thermal limits? Are these limits likely to change through natur
al selection? These and other important questions can be addressed with models r
elating geographical distributions of species with climate data, but inferences
made with these models are highly contingent on non-climatic factors such as bio
tic interactions. Improved understanding of climate change effects on species wi
ll require extensive analysis of thermal physiological traits, but such data are
scarce and scattered. To overcome current limitations, we created the GlobTherm
database. The database contains experimentally derived species’ thermal toleran
ce data currently comprising over 2,000 species of terrestrial, freshwater, inte
rtidal and marine multicellular algae, plants, fungi, and animals. The GlobTherm
database will be maintained and curated by iDiv with the aim of expanding it, a
nd enable further investigations on the effects of climate on the distribution o
f life on Earth."@en ;
dcterms:identifier "https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1cv08"^^xsd:anyURI ;
dcterms:creator <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7883-3577> ;
dcterms:relation <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1cv08/6> ;
dcterms:relation <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1cv08/7> ;
dcterms:isReferencedBy <https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.22>.

This example is available from the DXWG DCAT 3 code repository at
dryad-globtherm-sdata.ttl

C.4 Data services

Data services may be described using DCAT. The values of the
classifiers dcterms:type, dcterms:conformsTo, and
dcat:endpointDescription provide progressively more detail about a
service, whose actual endpoint is given by the dcat:endpointURL.

The first example describes a data catalog hosted by the European
Environment Agency (EEA). This is classified as a dcat:DataService and
has the dcterms:type set to "discovery" from the INSPIRE classification
of spatial data service types [INSPIRE-SDST].

This example is available from the DXWG DCAT 3 code repository at
eea-csw.ttl

Example 60

ex:EEA-CSW-Endpoint

dcterms:accessRights <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-

dcterms:conformsTo <http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/csw> ;
dcterms:description "The EEA public catalogue of spatial datasets references
the spatial datasets used by the European Environment Agency as well as
the spatial datasets produced by or for the EEA. In the latter case,
when datasets are publicly available, a link to the location from where
they can be downloaded is included in the dataset's metadata. The
catalogue has been initially populated with the most important spatial
datasets already available on the data&maps section of the EEA website
and is currently updated with any newly published spatial dataset."@en ;

ice=CSW&request=GetCapabilities> ;
dcat:endpointURL <http://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/eng/csw> ;
.

Example 61 shows a dataset hosted by Geoscience Australia, which is
available from three distinct services, as indicated by the value of
the dcat:servesDataset property of each of the service descriptions.
These are classified as a dcat:DataService and also have the
dcterms:type set to "download" and "view" from the INSPIRE
classification of spatial data service types [INSPIRE-SDST].

Example 61 is available from the DXWG DCAT 3 code repository at

C.5 Compressed and packaged distributions

The first example is for a distribution with a downloadable file that
is compressed into a GZIP file.

Example 62

@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<https://data.gov.cz/zdroj/datová-sada/247025684/22> a dcat:Distribution ;

* Added property dcat:inCatalog as the inverse of dcat:resource in
section 7. Use of inverse properties - see Issue #1484.
* Updated class diagram in Figure 1 to align it with the current
version of the specification. In particular:
+ Added newly defined properties - see Issue #1469.
+ Removed inverse properties listed in section 7. Use of inverse
properties - see Issues #1410 and #1413.
+ Removed cardinality restrictions not present in the RDF
definition - see resolution #3 of 8 March 2022.
* Added property dcat:seriesMember as the inverse of dcat:inSeries in
section 7. Use of inverse properties - see Issue #1335.
* Added Example 39 (12.1 How to specify dataset series) and
introductory paragraph to show how to combine dataset series and
dataset versions - see Issue #1409.
* Defined a new property dcat:resource to link a dcat:Catalog to a
dcat:Resource, thus replacing property dcterms:hasPart that in DCAT
2 was introduced for this purpose. As a consequence, properties
dcat:dataset, dcat:service, and dcat:catalog have been revised to
be sub-properties of dcat:resource - see Issue #1469.
* Added property dcterms:hasPart under dcat:Resource - see Issue
#1469.
* Fixed inconsistent URIs in Example 15 (8. Dereferenceable
identifiers) - see Issue #1459.
* Aligned the definitions of the properties dcat:dataset,
dcat:service, dcat:catalog - see Issue #1465.
* The definition of property dcat:version has been revised to make it
explicit that version indicators can be numeric or textual - see
Issue #1442.
* Revised Example 62, Example 63, and Example 64 (C.5 Compressed and
packaged distributions) to remove all occurrences of property
dcat:accessURL when taking as value the same URL of
dcat:downloadURL - see Issue #1437.
* Revised usage note of property dcat:packageFormat to include the
ZIP format as one of the examples of packaging formats - see Issue
#1438.
* Editorial fixes to 5.1 DCAT scope - see Issue #1440.

H. Changes since the second public working draft of 4 May 2021

The document has undergone the following changes since the DCAT 3
second public working draft of 4 May 2021 [VOCAB-DCAT-3-20210504]:
* New section 7. Use of inverse properties has been added, and
properties dcat:isVersionOf, dcat:next, and dcterms:isReplacedBy
have been removed from 6. Vocabulary specification - see Issue
#1336.
* New section 18. Accessibility Considerations has been added - see
Issue #1358.
* Revision of UML diagrams - see Issues #1383, #1294, #1252.
* Revision of the usage note of dcat:Resource - see Issue #1388.
* Clarified the scope of dcterms:identifier - see Issue #771.
* 5.3 Basic example has been updated to tell a more coherent story
(see Issue #1155) and express temporal coverage by using
dcterms:PeriodOfTime, dcat:startDate, and dcat:endDate.
* The usage notes of properties dcat:bbox and dcat:centroid have been
revised to make it clearer that they are supposed to be used only
with geometry literals - see Issue #1359.
* The property dcat:theme have been explicitly defined as an OWL
object property and its range is dropped; consistency of the usage
note of dcat:themeTaxonomy has been improved - see Issues #1364 and
#1153.

I. Changes since the first public working draft of 17 December 2020

The document has undergone the following changes since the DCAT 3 first
public working draft of 17 December 2020 [VOCAB-DCAT-3-20201217]:
* 5.3 Basic example has been extended to include titles, labels, and
keywords in two different languages (English and Spanish) to
illustrate the use of language tags.

* The recommended range of property 6.8.12 Property: byte size has
been changed from xsd:decimal to xsd:nonNegativeInteger

* 11. Versioning has been revised to focus specifically on versions
derived from the revision of a resource, and by following the [PAV]
approach for the specification of version chains and hierarchies -
previous, next, current, last version. In particular:
+ The introductory text has been revised according to the new
scope.
+ The section on version types (link to previous version) has
been removed, and a new section has been added to describe how
to specify relationships between versions.
+ Dropped support to the specification of backward
(in)compatibility between versions by using properties
owl:backwardCompatibleWith and owl:incompatibleWith,
originally included in 11.2 Version information.
+ A new section has been added at the end to compare the DCAT
versioning approach with those used in OWL, [DCTERMS], and
[PROV-O].
The other sections include only editorial changes.
* 6.4 Class: Cataloged Resource has been updated to include the
definition of the properties illustrated in 11. Versioning.
* 12. Dataset series has been revised making dataset series first
class citizens of data catalogs and introducing new properties for
linking dataset series and datasets. In particular:
+ A new class dcat:DatasetSeries has been defined (see 6.7
Class: Dataset Series) - see Issue #1272.
+ Property dcat:inSeries has been added to 6.6 Class: Dataset -
see Issue #1307.
+ Properties dcat:first, dcat:prev, dcat:next, and dcat:last
have been added to 6.4 Class: Cataloged Resource - see Issue
#1308.
* Added property spdx:checksum to 6.8 Class: Distribution; added
class spdx:Checksum (see 6.17 Class: Checksum), and its properties
spdx:algorithm and spdx:checksumValue - see Issue #1287.
* Revised range of property locn:geometry, to align it with its
definition in [LOCN]. The usage note of this property has been also
revised to make it clear that it can be used with either geometry
literals or classes - see Issue #1293.
* Added examples to 9. License and rights statements - see Issues
#676 and #1333.
* Replaced [DCTERMS] namespace prefix dct: with dcterms: throughout
the document - see Issue #1314.
* Fixed inconsistent use of "URI" and "IRI" throughout the document -
see Issue #1341.
* Removed NOTE in Example 31 showing an example of the use of
[W3C-BASIC-GEO] for the specification of point geometries - see
Issue #1347.
* Revised textual descriptions of classes and properties to clarify
that the resources in a catalog are not limited to datasets and
data services - see Issue #1349.
* Fixed inconsistent use of property labels - see Issue #1350.
* Updated definition for dcat:catalog - see Issue #1156.

J. Changes since the W3C Recommendation of 4 February 2020

The document has undergone the following changes since the DCAT 2 W3C
Recommendation of 4 February 2020 [VOCAB-DCAT-2-20200204]:
* Examples about loosely structured catalog were updated replacing
dcterms:relation with more specific subrelations and emphasizing
the use of dcterms:hasPart.
* Section 11. Versioning was extended with draft guidelines to deal
with version delta (Issue #89), version release date (Issue #91),
version identifier (Issue #92), version compatibility (Issue #1258)
and resource status (Issue #1238).
* A new section 12. Dataset series was added to draft guidelines on
dataset series (Issue #868) and to show related examples (Issue
#806).
