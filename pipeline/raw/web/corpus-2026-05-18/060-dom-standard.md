1. Infrastructure

This specification depends on the Infra Standard. [INFRA]

Some of the terms used in this specification are defined in Encoding,
Selectors, Trusted Types, Web IDL, XML, and Namespaces in XML.
[ENCODING] [SELECTORS4] [TRUSTED-TYPES] [WEBIDL] [XML] [XML-NAMES]

When extensions are needed, the DOM Standard can be updated
accordingly, or a new standard can be written that hooks into the
provided extensibility hooks for applicable specifications.

1.1. Trees

A tree is a finite hierarchical tree structure. In tree order is
preorder, depth-first traversal of a tree.

An object that participates in a tree has a parent, which is either
null or an object, and has children, which is an ordered set of
objects. An object A whose parent is object B is a child of B.

The root of an object is itself, if its parent is null, or else it is
the root of its parent. The root of a tree is any object participating
in that tree whose parent is null.

An object A is called a descendant of an object B, if either A is a
child of B or A is a child of an object C that is a descendant of B.

An inclusive descendant is an object or one of its descendants.

An object A is called an ancestor of an object B if and only if B is a
descendant of A.

An inclusive ancestor is an object or one of its ancestors.

An object A is called a sibling of an object B, if and only if B and A
share the same non-null parent.

An inclusive sibling is an object or one of its siblings.

An object A is preceding an object B if A and B are in the same tree
and A comes before B in tree order.

An object A is following an object B if A and B are in the same tree
and A comes after B in tree order.

The first child of an object is its first child or null if it has no
children.

The last child of an object is its last child or null if it has no
children.

The previous sibling of an object is its first preceding sibling or
null if it has no preceding sibling.

The next sibling of an object is its first following sibling or null if
it has no following sibling.

The index of an object is its number of preceding siblings, or 0 if it
has none.

1.2. Ordered sets

The ordered set parser takes a string input and then runs these steps:
1. Let inputTokens be the result of splitting input on ASCII
whitespace.
2. Let tokens be a new ordered set.
3. For each token of inputTokens: append token to tokens.
4. Return tokens.

The ordered set serializer takes a set and returns the concatenation of
set using U+0020 SPACE.

1.3. Selectors

To scope-match a selectors string given a string selectors against a
node node:
1. Let selector be the result of parse a selector selectors.
[SELECTORS4]
2. If selector is failure, then throw a "SyntaxError" DOMException.
3. Return the result of match a selector against a tree with selector
and node’s root using scoping root node. [SELECTORS4].

Support for namespaces within selectors is not planned and will not be
added.

1.4. Name validation

A string is a valid namespace prefix if its length is at least 1 and it
does not contain ASCII whitespace, U+0000 NULL, U+002F (/), or U+003E
(>).

A string is a valid attribute local name if its length is at least 1
and it does not contain ASCII whitespace, U+0000 NULL, U+002F (/),
U+003D (=), or U+003E (>).

A string name is a valid element local name if the following steps
return true:
1. If name’s length is 0, then return false.
2. If name’s 0th code point is an ASCII alpha:
1. If name contains ASCII whitespace, U+0000 NULL, U+002F (/), or
U+003E (>), then return false.
2. Return true.
3. If name’s 0th code point is not U+003A (:), U+005F (_), or in the
range U+0080 to U+10FFFF, inclusive, then return false.
4. If name’s subsequent code points, if any, are not ASCII alphas,
ASCII digits, U+002D (-), U+002E (.), U+003A (:), U+005F (_), or in
the range U+0080 to U+10FFFF, inclusive, then return false.
5. Return true.

This concept is used to validate element local names, when constructed
by DOM APIs. The intention is to allow any name that is possible to
construct using the HTML parser (the branch where the first code point
is an ASCII alpha), plus some additional possibilities. For those
additional possibilities, the ASCII range is restricted for historical
reasons, but beyond ASCII anything is allowed.

The following JavaScript-compatible regular expression is an
implementation of valid element local name:
/^(?:[A-Za-z][^\0\t\n\f\r\u0020/>]*|[:_\u0080-\u{10FFFF}][A-Za-z0-9-.:_\u0080-\u
{10FFFF}]*)$/u

A string is a valid doctype name if it does not contain ASCII
whitespace, U+0000 NULL, or U+003E (>).

The empty string is a valid doctype name.

To validate and extract a namespace and qualifiedName, given a context:
1. If namespace is the empty string, then set it to null.
2. Let prefix be null.
3. Let localName be qualifiedName.
4. If qualifiedName contains a U+003A (:):
1. Set prefix to the part of qualifiedName before the first
U+003A (:).
2. Set localName to the part of qualifiedName after the first
U+003A (:).
3. If prefix is not a valid namespace prefix, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
5. Assert: prefix is either null or a valid namespace prefix.
6. If context is "attribute" and localName is not a valid attribute
local name, then throw an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
7. If context is "element" and localName is not a valid element local
name, then throw an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
8. If prefix is non-null and namespace is null, then throw a
"NamespaceError" DOMException.
9. If prefix is "xml" and namespace is not the XML namespace, then
throw a "NamespaceError" DOMException.
10. If either qualifiedName or prefix is "xmlns" and namespace is not
the XMLNS namespace, then throw a "NamespaceError" DOMException.
11. If namespace is the XMLNS namespace and neither qualifiedName nor
prefix is "xmlns", then throw a "NamespaceError" DOMException.
12. Return (namespace, prefix, localName).

Various APIs in this specification used to validate namespace prefixes,
attribute local names, element local names, and doctype names more
strictly. This was done in a way that aligned with various XML-related
specifications. (Although not all rules from the those specifications
were enforced.)

This was found to be annoying for web developers, especially since it
meant there were some names that could be created by the HTML parser,
but not by DOM APIs. So, the validations have been loosened to just
those described above.

2. Events

2.1. Introduction to "DOM Events"

Throughout the web platform events are dispatched to objects to signal
an occurrence, such as network activity or user interaction. These
objects implement the EventTarget interface and can therefore add event
listeners to observe events by calling addEventListener():
obj.addEventListener("load", imgFetched)

function imgFetched(ev) {
// great success
…
}

Event listeners can be removed by utilizing the removeEventListener()
method, passing the same arguments.

Alternatively, event listeners can be removed by passing an AbortSignal
to addEventListener() and calling abort() on the controller owning the
signal.

Events are objects too and implement the Event interface (or a derived
interface). In the example above ev is the event. ev is passed as an
argument to the event listener’s callback (typically a JavaScript
Function as shown above). Event listeners key off the event’s type
attribute value ("load" in the above example). The event’s target
attribute value returns the object to which the event was dispatched
(obj above).

Although events are typically dispatched by the user agent as the
result of user interaction or the completion of some task, applications
can dispatch events themselves by using what are commonly known as
synthetic events:
// add an appropriate event listener
obj.addEventListener("cat", function(e) { process(e.detail) })

// create and dispatch the event
var event = new CustomEvent("cat", {"detail":{"hazcheeseburger":true}})
obj.dispatchEvent(event)

Apart from signaling, events are sometimes also used to let an
application control what happens next in an operation. For instance as
part of form submission an event whose type attribute value is "submit"
is dispatched. If this event’s preventDefault() method is invoked, form
submission will be terminated. Applications who wish to make use of
this functionality through events dispatched by the application
(synthetic events) can make use of the return value of the
dispatchEvent() method:
if(obj.dispatchEvent(event)) {
// event was not canceled, time for some magic
…
}

When an event is dispatched to an object that participates in a tree
(e.g., an element), it can reach event listeners on that object’s
ancestors too. Effectively, all the object’s inclusive ancestor event
listeners whose capture is true are invoked, in tree order. And then,
if event’s bubbles is true, all the object’s inclusive ancestor event
listeners whose capture is false are invoked, now in reverse tree
order.

Let’s look at an example of how events work in a tree:
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Boring example</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hello <span id=x>world</span>!</p>
<script>
function test(e) {
debug(e.target, e.currentTarget, e.eventPhase)
}
document.addEventListener("hey", test, {capture: true})
document.body.addEventListener("hey", test)
var ev = new Event("hey", {bubbles:true})
document.getElementById("x").dispatchEvent(ev)
</script>
</body>
</html>

The debug function will be invoked twice. Each time the event’s target
attribute value will be the span element. The first time currentTarget
attribute’s value will be the document, the second time the body
element. eventPhase attribute’s value switches from CAPTURING_PHASE to
BUBBLING_PHASE. If an event listener was registered for the span
element, eventPhase attribute’s value would have been AT_TARGET.

2.2. Interface Event

[Exposed=*]
interface Event {
constructor(DOMString type, optional EventInit eventInitDict = {});

readonly attribute DOMString type;
readonly attribute EventTarget? target;
readonly attribute EventTarget? srcElement; // legacy
readonly attribute EventTarget? currentTarget;
sequence<EventTarget> composedPath();

const unsigned short NONE = 0;
const unsigned short CAPTURING_PHASE = 1;
const unsigned short AT_TARGET = 2;
const unsigned short BUBBLING_PHASE = 3;
readonly attribute unsigned short eventPhase;

undefined stopPropagation();
attribute boolean cancelBubble; // legacy alias of .stopPropagation()
undefined stopImmediatePropagation();

readonly attribute boolean bubbles;
readonly attribute boolean cancelable;
attribute boolean returnValue; // legacy
undefined preventDefault();
readonly attribute boolean defaultPrevented;
readonly attribute boolean composed;

[LegacyUnforgeable] readonly attribute boolean isTrusted;
readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp timeStamp;

undefined initEvent(DOMString type, optional boolean bubbles = false, optional
boolean cancelable = false); // legacy
};

dictionary EventInit {
boolean bubbles = false;
boolean cancelable = false;
boolean composed = false;
};

An Event object is simply named an event. It allows for signaling that
something has occurred, e.g., that an image has completed downloading.

A potential event target is null or an EventTarget object.

An event has an associated target (a potential event target). Unless
stated otherwise it is null.

An event has an associated relatedTarget (a potential event target).
Unless stated otherwise it is null.

Other specifications use relatedTarget to define a relatedTarget
attribute. [UIEVENTS]

An event has an associated touch target list (a list of zero or more
potential event targets). Unless stated otherwise it is the empty list.

The touch target list is for the exclusive use of defining the
TouchEvent interface and related interfaces. [TOUCH-EVENTS]

An event has an associated path. A path is a list of structs. Each
struct consists of an invocation target (an EventTarget object), an
invocation-target-in-shadow-tree (a boolean), a shadow-adjusted target
(a potential event target), a relatedTarget (a potential event target),
a touch target list (a list of potential event targets), a
root-of-closed-tree (a boolean), and a slot-in-closed-tree (a boolean).
A path is initially the empty list.

event = new Event(type [, eventInitDict])
Returns a new event whose type attribute value is set to type.
The eventInitDict argument allows for setting the bubbles and
cancelable attributes via object members of the same name.

event . type
Returns the type of event, e.g. "click", "hashchange", or
"submit".

event . target
Returns the object to which event is dispatched (its target).

event . currentTarget
Returns the object whose event listener’s callback is currently
being invoked.

event . composedPath()
Returns the invocation target objects of event’s path (objects
on which listeners will be invoked), except for any nodes in
shadow trees of which the shadow root’s mode is "closed" that
are not reachable from event’s currentTarget.

event . eventPhase
Returns the event’s phase, which is one of NONE,
CAPTURING_PHASE, AT_TARGET, and BUBBLING_PHASE.

event . stopPropagation()
When dispatched in a tree, invoking this method prevents event
from reaching any objects other than the current object.

event . stopImmediatePropagation()
Invoking this method prevents event from reaching any registered
event listeners after the current one finishes running and, when
dispatched in a tree, also prevents event from reaching any
other objects.

event . bubbles
Returns true or false depending on how event was initialized.
True if event goes through its target’s ancestors in reverse
tree order; otherwise false.

event . cancelable
Returns true or false depending on how event was initialized.
Its return value does not always carry meaning, but true can
indicate that part of the operation during which event was
dispatched, can be canceled by invoking the preventDefault()
method.

event . preventDefault()
If invoked when the cancelable attribute value is true, and
while executing a listener for the event with passive set to
false, signals to the operation that caused event to be
dispatched that it needs to be canceled.

event . defaultPrevented
Returns true if preventDefault() was invoked successfully to
indicate cancelation; otherwise false.

event . composed
Returns true or false depending on how event was initialized.
True if event invokes listeners past a ShadowRoot node that is
the root of its target; otherwise false.

event . isTrusted
Returns true if event was dispatched by the user agent, and
false otherwise.

event . timeStamp
Returns the event’s timestamp as the number of milliseconds
measured relative to the occurrence.

The type attribute must return the value it was initialized to. When an
event is created the attribute must be initialized to the empty string.

The target getter steps are to return this’s target.

The srcElement getter steps are to return this’s target.

The currentTarget attribute must return the value it was initialized
to. When an event is created the attribute must be initialized to null.

The composedPath() method steps are:
1. Let composedPath be an empty list.
2. Let path be this’s path.
3. If path is empty, then return composedPath.
4. Let currentTarget be this’s currentTarget attribute value.
5. Assert: currentTarget is an EventTarget object.
6. Append currentTarget to composedPath.
7. Let currentTargetIndex be 0.
8. Let currentTargetHiddenSubtreeLevel be 0.
9. Let index be path’s size − 1.
10. While index is greater than or equal to 0:
1. If path[index]'s root-of-closed-tree is true, then increase
currentTargetHiddenSubtreeLevel by 1.
2. If path[index]'s invocation target is currentTarget, then set
currentTargetIndex to index and break.
3. If path[index]'s slot-in-closed-tree is true, then decrease
currentTargetHiddenSubtreeLevel by 1.
4. Decrease index by 1.
11. Let currentHiddenLevel and maxHiddenLevel be
currentTargetHiddenSubtreeLevel.
12. Set index to currentTargetIndex − 1.
13. While index is greater than or equal to 0:
1. If path[index]'s root-of-closed-tree is true, then increase
currentHiddenLevel by 1.
2. If currentHiddenLevel is less than or equal to maxHiddenLevel,
then prepend path[index]'s invocation target to composedPath.
3. If path[index]'s slot-in-closed-tree is true:
1. Decrease currentHiddenLevel by 1.
2. If currentHiddenLevel is less than maxHiddenLevel, then
set maxHiddenLevel to currentHiddenLevel.
4. Decrease index by 1.
14. Set currentHiddenLevel and maxHiddenLevel to
currentTargetHiddenSubtreeLevel.
15. Set index to currentTargetIndex + 1.
16. While index is less than path’s size:
1. If path[index]'s slot-in-closed-tree is true, then increase
currentHiddenLevel by 1.
2. If currentHiddenLevel is less than or equal to maxHiddenLevel,
then append path[index]'s invocation target to composedPath.
3. If path[index]'s root-of-closed-tree is true:
1. Decrease currentHiddenLevel by 1.
2. If currentHiddenLevel is less than maxHiddenLevel, then
set maxHiddenLevel to currentHiddenLevel.
4. Increase index by 1.
17. Return composedPath.

The eventPhase attribute must return the value it was initialized to,
which must be one of the following:

NONE (numeric value 0)
Events not currently dispatched are in this phase.

CAPTURING_PHASE (numeric value 1)
When an event is dispatched to an object that participates in a
tree it will be in this phase before it reaches its target.

AT_TARGET (numeric value 2)
When an event is dispatched it will be in this phase on its
target.

BUBBLING_PHASE (numeric value 3)
When an event is dispatched to an object that participates in a
tree it will be in this phase after it reaches its target.

Initially the attribute must be initialized to NONE.
__________________________________________________________________

Each event has the following associated flags that are all initially
unset:
* stop propagation flag
* stop immediate propagation flag
* canceled flag
* in passive listener flag
* composed flag
* initialized flag
* dispatch flag

The stopPropagation() method steps are to set this’s stop propagation
flag.

The cancelBubble getter steps are to return true if this’s stop
propagation flag is set; otherwise false.

The cancelBubble setter steps are to set this’s stop propagation flag
if the given value is true; otherwise do nothing.

The stopImmediatePropagation() method steps are to set this’s stop
propagation flag and this’s stop immediate propagation flag.

The bubbles and cancelable attributes must return the values they were
initialized to.

To set the canceled flag, given an event event, if event’s cancelable
attribute value is true and event’s in passive listener flag is unset,
then set event’s canceled flag, and do nothing otherwise.

The returnValue getter steps are to return false if this’s canceled
flag is set; otherwise true.

The returnValue setter steps are to set the canceled flag with this if
the given value is false; otherwise do nothing.

The preventDefault() method steps are to set the canceled flag with
this.

There are scenarios where invoking preventDefault() has no effect. User
agents are encouraged to log the precise cause in a developer console,
to aid debugging.

The defaultPrevented getter steps are to return true if this’s canceled
flag is set; otherwise false.

The composed getter steps are to return true if this’s composed flag is
set; otherwise false.
__________________________________________________________________

The isTrusted attribute must return the value it was initialized to.
When an event is created the attribute must be initialized to false.

isTrusted is a convenience that indicates whether an event is
dispatched by the user agent (as opposed to using dispatchEvent()). The
sole legacy exception is click(), which causes the user agent to
dispatch an event whose isTrusted attribute is initialized to false.

The timeStamp attribute must return the value it was initialized to.
__________________________________________________________________

To initialize an event, with type, bubbles, and cancelable, run these
steps:
1. Set event’s initialized flag.
2. Unset event’s stop propagation flag, stop immediate propagation
flag, and canceled flag.
3. Set event’s isTrusted attribute to false.
4. Set event’s target to null.
5. Set event’s type attribute to type.
6. Set event’s bubbles attribute to bubbles.
7. Set event’s cancelable attribute to cancelable.

The initEvent(type, bubbles, cancelable) method steps are:
1. If this’s dispatch flag is set, then return.
2. Initialize this with type, bubbles, and cancelable.

initEvent() is redundant with event constructors and incapable of
setting composed. It has to be supported for legacy content.

2.3. Legacy extensions to the Window interface

partial interface Window {
[Replaceable] readonly attribute (Event or undefined) event; // legacy
};

Each Window object has an associated current event (undefined or an
Event object). Unless stated otherwise it is undefined.

The event getter steps are to return this’s current event.

Web developers are strongly encouraged to instead rely on the Event
object passed to event listeners, as that will result in more portable
code. This attribute is not available in workers or worklets, and is
inaccurate for events dispatched in shadow trees.

2.4. Interface CustomEvent

[Exposed=*]
interface CustomEvent : Event {
constructor(DOMString type, optional CustomEventInit eventInitDict = {});

readonly attribute any detail;

undefined initCustomEvent(DOMString type, optional boolean bubbles = false, op
tional boolean cancelable = false, optional any detail = null); // legacy
};

dictionary CustomEventInit : EventInit {
any detail = null;
};

Events using the CustomEvent interface can be used to carry custom
data.

event = new CustomEvent(type [, eventInitDict])
Works analogously to the constructor for Event except that the
eventInitDict argument now allows for setting the detail
attribute too.

event . detail
Returns any custom data event was created with. Typically used
for synthetic events.

The detail attribute must return the value it was initialized to.

The initCustomEvent(type, bubbles, cancelable, detail) method steps
are:
1. If this’s dispatch flag is set, then return.
2. Initialize this with type, bubbles, and cancelable.
3. Set this’s detail attribute to detail.

2.5. Constructing events

Specifications may define event constructing steps for all or some
events. The algorithm is passed an event event and an EventInit
eventInitDict as indicated in the inner event creation steps.

This construct can be used by Event subclasses that have a more complex
structure than a simple 1:1 mapping between their initializing
dictionary members and IDL attributes.

When a constructor of the Event interface, or of an interface that
inherits from the Event interface, is invoked, these steps must be run,
given the arguments type and eventInitDict:
1. Let event be the result of running the inner event creation steps
with this interface, null, now, and eventInitDict.
2. Initialize event’s type attribute to type.
3. Return event.

To create an event using eventInterface, which must be either Event or
an interface that inherits from it, and optionally given a realm realm,
run these steps:
1. If realm is not given, then set it to null.
2. Let dictionary be the result of converting the JavaScript value
undefined to the dictionary type accepted by eventInterface’s
constructor. (This dictionary type will either be EventInit or a
dictionary that inherits from it.)
This does not work if members are required; see whatwg/dom#600.
3. Let event be the result of running the inner event creation steps
with eventInterface, realm, the time of the occurrence that the
event is signaling, and dictionary.
In macOS the time of the occurrence for input actions is available
via the timestamp property of NSEvent objects.
4. Initialize event’s isTrusted attribute to true.
5. Return event.

Create an event is meant to be used by other specifications which need
to separately create and dispatch events, instead of simply firing
them. It ensures the event’s attributes are initialized to the correct
defaults.

The inner event creation steps, given an eventInterface, realm, time,
and dictionary, are as follows:
1. Let event be the result of creating a new object using
eventInterface. If realm is non-null, then use that realm;
otherwise, use the default behavior defined in Web IDL.
As of the time of this writing Web IDL does not yet define any
default behavior; see whatwg/webidl#135.
2. Set event’s initialized flag.
3. Initialize event’s timeStamp attribute to the relative high
resolution coarse time given time and event’s relevant global
object.
4. For each member → value of dictionary: if event has an attribute
whose identifier is member, then initialize that attribute to
value.
5. Run the event constructing steps with event and dictionary.
6. Return event.

2.6. Defining event interfaces

In general, when defining a new interface that inherits from Event
please always ask feedback from the WHATWG or the W3C WebApps WG
community.

The CustomEvent interface can be used as starting point. However, do
not introduce any init*Event() methods as they are redundant with
constructors. Interfaces that inherit from the Event interface that
have such a method only have it for historical reasons.

2.7. Interface EventTarget

[Exposed=*]
interface EventTarget {
constructor();

undefined addEventListener(DOMString type, EventListener? callback, optional (
AddEventListenerOptions or boolean) options = {});
undefined removeEventListener(DOMString type, EventListener? callback, optiona
l (EventListenerOptions or boolean) options = {});
boolean dispatchEvent(Event event);
};

callback interface EventListener {
undefined handleEvent(Event event);
};

dictionary EventListenerOptions {
boolean capture = false;
};

dictionary AddEventListenerOptions : EventListenerOptions {
boolean passive;
boolean once = false;
AbortSignal signal;
};

An EventTarget object represents a target to which an event can be
dispatched when something has occurred.

Each EventTarget object has an associated event listener list (a list
of zero or more event listeners). It is initially the empty list.

An event listener can be used to observe a specific event and consists
of:
* type (a string)
* callback (null or an EventListener object)
* capture (a boolean, initially false)
* passive (null or a boolean, initially null)
* once (a boolean, initially false)
* signal (null or an AbortSignal object)
* removed (a boolean for bookkeeping purposes, initially false)

Although callback is an EventListener object, an event listener is a
broader concept as can be seen above.

Each EventTarget object also has an associated get the parent
algorithm, which takes an event event, and returns an EventTarget
object. Unless specified otherwise it returns null.

Nodes, shadow roots, and documents override the get the parent
algorithm.

Each EventTarget object can have an associated activation behavior
algorithm. The activation behavior algorithm is passed an event, as
indicated in the dispatch algorithm.

This exists because user agents perform certain actions for certain
EventTarget objects, e.g., the area element, in response to synthetic
MouseEvent events whose type attribute is click. Web compatibility
prevented it from being removed and it is now the enshrined way of
defining an activation of something. [HTML]

Each EventTarget object that has activation behavior, can additionally
have both (not either) a legacy-pre-activation behavior algorithm and a
legacy-canceled-activation behavior algorithm.

These algorithms only exist for checkbox and radio input elements and
are not to be used for anything else. [HTML]

target = new EventTarget();
Creates a new EventTarget object, which can be used by
developers to dispatch and listen for events.

target . addEventListener(type, callback [, options])
Appends an event listener for events whose type attribute value
is type. The callback argument sets the callback that will be
invoked when the event is dispatched.

The options argument sets listener-specific options. For
compatibility this can be a boolean, in which case the method
behaves exactly as if the value was specified as options’s
capture.

When set to true, options’s capture prevents callback from being
invoked when the event’s eventPhase attribute value is
BUBBLING_PHASE. When false (or not present), callback will not
be invoked when event’s eventPhase attribute value is
CAPTURING_PHASE. Either way, callback will be invoked if event’s
eventPhase attribute value is AT_TARGET.

When set to true, options’s passive indicates that the callback
will not cancel the event by invoking preventDefault(). This is
used to enable performance optimizations described in § 2.8
Observing event listeners.

When set to true, options’s once indicates that the callback
will only be invoked once after which the event listener will be
removed.

If an AbortSignal is passed for options’s signal, then the event
listener will be removed when signal is aborted.

The event listener is appended to target’s event listener list
and is not appended if it has the same type, callback, and
capture.

target . removeEventListener(type, callback [, options])
Removes the event listener in target’s event listener list with
the same type, callback, and options.

target . dispatchEvent(event)
Dispatches a synthetic event event to target and returns true if
either event’s cancelable attribute value is false or its
preventDefault() method was not invoked; otherwise false.

To flatten options, run these steps:
1. If options is a boolean, then return options.
2. Return options["capture"].

To flatten more options, run these steps:
1. Let capture be the result of flattening options.
2. Let once be false.
3. Let passive and signal be null.
4. If options is a dictionary:
1. Set once to options["once"].
2. If options["passive"] exists, then set passive to
options["passive"].
3. If options["signal"] exists, then set signal to
options["signal"].
5. Return capture, passive, once, and signal.

The new EventTarget() constructor steps are to do nothing.

Because of the defaults stated elsewhere, the returned EventTarget’s
get the parent algorithm will return null, and it will have no
activation behavior, legacy-pre-activation behavior, or
legacy-canceled-activation behavior.

In the future we could allow custom get the parent algorithms. Let us
know if this would be useful for your programs. For now, all
author-created EventTargets do not participate in a tree structure.

The default passive value, given an event type type and an EventTarget
eventTarget, is determined as follows:
1. Return true if all of the following are true:
+ type is one of "touchstart", "touchmove", "wheel", or
"mousewheel". [TOUCH-EVENTS] [UIEVENTS]
+ eventTarget is a Window object, or is a node whose node
document is eventTarget, or is a node whose node document’s
document element is eventTarget, or is a node whose node
document’s body element is eventTarget. [HTML]
2. Return false.

To add an event listener, given an EventTarget object eventTarget and
an event listener listener, run these steps:
1. If eventTarget is a ServiceWorkerGlobalScope object, its service
worker’s script resource’s has ever been evaluated flag is set, and
listener’s type matches the type attribute value of any of the
service worker events, then report a warning to the console that
this might not give the expected results. [SERVICE-WORKERS]
2. If listener’s signal is non-null and is aborted, then return.
3. If listener’s callback is null, then return.
4. If listener’s passive is null, then set it to the default passive
value given listener’s type and eventTarget.
5. If eventTarget’s event listener list does not contain an event
listener whose type is listener’s type, callback is listener’s
callback, and capture is listener’s capture, then append listener
to eventTarget’s event listener list.
6. If listener’s signal is non-null, then add the following abort
steps to it:
1. Remove an event listener with eventTarget and listener.

The add an event listener concept exists to ensure event handlers use
the same code path. [HTML]

The addEventListener(type, callback, options) method steps are:
1. Let capture, passive, once, and signal be the result of flattening
more options.
2. Add an event listener with this and an event listener whose type is
type, callback is callback, capture is capture, passive is passive,
once is once, and signal is signal.

To remove an event listener, given an EventTarget object eventTarget
and an event listener listener, run these steps:
1. If eventTarget is a ServiceWorkerGlobalScope object and its service
worker’s set of event types to handle contains listener’s type,
then report a warning to the console that this might not give the
expected results. [SERVICE-WORKERS]
2. Set listener’s removed to true and remove listener from
eventTarget’s event listener list.

HTML needs this to define event handlers. [HTML]

To remove all event listeners, given an EventTarget object eventTarget:
for each listener of eventTarget’s event listener list: remove an event
listener with eventTarget and listener.

HTML needs this to define document.open(). [HTML]

The removeEventListener(type, callback, options) method steps are:
1. Let capture be the result of flattening options.
2. If this’s event listener list contains an event listener whose type
is type, callback is callback, and capture is capture, then remove
an event listener with this and that event listener.

The event listener list will not contain multiple event listeners with
equal type, callback, and capture, as add an event listener prevents
that.

The dispatchEvent(event) method steps are:
1. If event’s dispatch flag is set, or if its initialized flag is not
set, then throw an "InvalidStateError" DOMException.
2. Initialize event’s isTrusted attribute to false.
3. Return the result of dispatching event to this.

2.8. Observing event listeners

In general, developers do not expect the presence of an event listener
to be observable. The impact of an event listener is determined by its
callback. That is, a developer adding a no-op event listener would not
expect it to have any side effects.

Unfortunately, some event APIs have been designed such that
implementing them efficiently requires observing event listeners. This
can make the presence of listeners observable in that even empty
listeners can have a dramatic performance impact on the behavior of the
application. For example, touch and wheel events which can be used to
block asynchronous scrolling. In some cases this problem can be
mitigated by specifying the event to be cancelable only when there is
at least one non-passive listener. For example, non-passive TouchEvent
listeners must block scrolling, but if all listeners are passive then
scrolling can be allowed to start in parallel by making the TouchEvent
uncancelable (so that calls to preventDefault() are ignored). So code
dispatching an event is able to observe the absence of non-passive
listeners, and use that to clear the cancelable property of the event
being dispatched.

Ideally, any new event APIs are defined such that they do not need this
property. (Use whatwg/dom for discussion.)

To legacy-obtain service worker fetch event listener callbacks given a
ServiceWorkerGlobalScope global, run these steps. They return a list of
EventListener objects.
1. Let callbacks be « ».
2. For each listener of global’s event listener list: if listener’s
type is "fetch" and listener’s callback is non-null, then append
listener’s callback to callbacks.
3. Return callbacks.

2.9. Dispatching events

To dispatch an event to a target, with an optional legacy target
override flag and an optional legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag, run
these steps:
1. Set event’s dispatch flag.
2. Let targetOverride be target, if legacy target override flag is not
given, and target’s associated Document otherwise. [HTML]
legacy target override flag is only used by HTML and only when
target is a Window object.
3. Let activationTarget be null.
4. Let relatedTarget be the result of retargeting event’s
relatedTarget against target.
5. Let clearTargets be false.
6. If target is not relatedTarget or target is event’s relatedTarget:
1. Let touchTargets be a new list.
2. For each touchTarget of event’s touch target list: append the
result of retargeting touchTarget against target to
touchTargets.
3. Append to an event path with event, target, targetOverride,
relatedTarget, touchTargets, and false.
4. Let isActivationEvent be true, if event is a MouseEvent object
and event’s type attribute is "click"; otherwise false.
5. If isActivationEvent is true and target has activation
behavior, then set activationTarget to target.
6. Let slottable be target, if target is a slottable and is
assigned, and null otherwise.
7. Let slot-in-closed-tree be false.
8. Let parent be the result of invoking target’s get the parent
with event.
9. While parent is non-null:
1. If slottable is non-null:
1. Assert: parent is a slot.
2. Set slottable to null.
3. If parent’s root is a shadow root whose mode is
"closed", then set slot-in-closed-tree to true.
2. If parent is a slottable and is assigned, then set
slottable to parent.
3. Let relatedTarget be the result of retargeting event’s
relatedTarget against parent.
4. Let touchTargets be a new list.
5. For each touchTarget of event’s touch target list: append
the result of retargeting touchTarget against parent to
touchTargets.
6. If parent is a Window object, or parent is a node and
target’s root is a shadow-including inclusive ancestor of
parent:
1. If isActivationEvent is true, event’s bubbles
attribute is true, activationTarget is null, and
parent has activation behavior, then set
activationTarget to parent.
2. Append to an event path with event, parent, null,
relatedTarget, touchTargets, and
slot-in-closed-tree.
7. Otherwise, if parent is relatedTarget, then set parent to
null.
8. Otherwise:
1. Set target to parent.
2. If isActivationEvent is true, activationTarget is
null, and target has activation behavior, then set
activationTarget to target.
3. Append to an event path with event, parent, target,
relatedTarget, touchTargets, and
slot-in-closed-tree.
9. If parent is non-null, then set parent to the result of
invoking parent’s get the parent with event.
10. Set slot-in-closed-tree to false.
10. Let clearTargetsStruct be the last struct in event’s path
whose shadow-adjusted target is non-null.
11. If clearTargetsStruct’s shadow-adjusted target,
clearTargetsStruct’s relatedTarget, or an EventTarget object
in clearTargetsStruct’s touch target list is a node whose root
is a shadow root: set clearTargets to true.
12. If activationTarget is non-null and activationTarget has
legacy-pre-activation behavior, then run activationTarget’s
legacy-pre-activation behavior.
13. For each struct of event’s path, in reverse order:
1. If struct’s shadow-adjusted target is non-null, then set
event’s eventPhase attribute to AT_TARGET.
2. Otherwise, set event’s eventPhase attribute to
CAPTURING_PHASE.
3. Invoke with struct, event, "capturing", and
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag if given.
14. For each struct of event’s path:
1. If struct’s shadow-adjusted target is non-null, then set
event’s eventPhase attribute to AT_TARGET.
2. Otherwise:
1. If event’s bubbles attribute is false, then
continue.
2. Set event’s eventPhase attribute to BUBBLING_PHASE.
3. Invoke with struct, event, "bubbling", and
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag if given.
7. Set event’s eventPhase attribute to NONE.
8. Set event’s currentTarget attribute to null.
9. Set event’s path to the empty list.
10. Unset event’s dispatch flag, stop propagation flag, and stop
immediate propagation flag.
11. If clearTargets is true:
1. Set event’s target to null.
2. Set event’s relatedTarget to null.
3. Set event’s touch target list to the empty list.
12. If activationTarget is non-null:
1. If event’s canceled flag is unset, then run activationTarget’s
activation behavior with event.
2. Otherwise, if activationTarget has legacy-canceled-activation
behavior, then run activationTarget’s
legacy-canceled-activation behavior.
13. Return false if event’s canceled flag is set; otherwise true.

To append to an event path, given an event, invocationTarget,
shadowAdjustedTarget, relatedTarget, touchTargets, and a
slot-in-closed-tree, run these steps:
1. Let invocationTargetInShadowTree be false.
2. If invocationTarget is a node and its root is a shadow root, then
set invocationTargetInShadowTree to true.
3. Let root-of-closed-tree be false.
4. If invocationTarget is a shadow root whose mode is "closed", then
set root-of-closed-tree to true.
5. Append a new struct to event’s path whose invocation target is
invocationTarget, invocation-target-in-shadow-tree is
invocationTargetInShadowTree, shadow-adjusted target is
shadowAdjustedTarget, relatedTarget is relatedTarget, touch target
list is touchTargets, root-of-closed-tree is root-of-closed-tree,
and slot-in-closed-tree is slot-in-closed-tree.

To invoke, given a struct, event, phase, and an optional
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag, run these steps:
1. Set event’s target to the shadow-adjusted target of the last struct
in event’s path, that is either struct or preceding struct, whose
shadow-adjusted target is non-null.
2. Set event’s relatedTarget to struct’s relatedTarget.
3. Set event’s touch target list to struct’s touch target list.
4. If event’s stop propagation flag is set, then return.
5. Initialize event’s currentTarget attribute to struct’s invocation
target.
6. Let listeners be a clone of event’s currentTarget attribute value’s
event listener list.
This avoids event listeners added after this point from being run.
Note that removal still has an effect due to the removed field.
7. Let invocationTargetInShadowTree be struct’s
invocation-target-in-shadow-tree.
8. Let found be the result of running inner invoke with event,
listeners, phase, invocationTargetInShadowTree, and
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag if given.
9. If found is false and event’s isTrusted attribute is true:
1. Let originalEventType be event’s type attribute value.
2. If event’s type attribute value is a match for any of the
strings in the first column in the following table, set
event’s type attribute value to the string in the second
column on the same row as the matching string, and return
otherwise.

Event type Legacy event type
"animationend" "webkitAnimationEnd"
"animationiteration" "webkitAnimationIteration"
"animationstart" "webkitAnimationStart"
"transitionend" "webkitTransitionEnd"
3. Inner invoke with event, listeners, phase,
invocationTargetInShadowTree, and
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag if given.
4. Set event’s type attribute value to originalEventType.

To inner invoke, given an event, listeners, phase,
invocationTargetInShadowTree, and an optional
legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag, run these steps:
1. Let found be false.
2. For each listener of listeners, whose removed is false:
1. If event’s type attribute value is not listener’s type, then
continue.
2. Set found to true.
3. If phase is "capturing" and listener’s capture is false, then
continue.
4. If phase is "bubbling" and listener’s capture is true, then
continue.
5. If listener’s once is true, then remove an event listener
given event’s currentTarget attribute value and listener.
6. Let global be listener callback’s associated realm’s global
object.
7. Let currentEvent be undefined.
8. If global is a Window object:
1. Set currentEvent to global’s current event.
2. If invocationTargetInShadowTree is false, then set
global’s current event to event.
9. If listener’s passive is true, then set event’s in passive
listener flag.
10. If global is a Window object, then record timing info for
event listener given event and listener.
11. Call a user object’s operation with listener’s callback,
"handleEvent", « event », and event’s currentTarget attribute
value. If this throws an exception exception:
1. Report exception for listener’s callback’s corresponding
JavaScript object’s associated realm’s global object.
2. Set legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag if given.
The legacyOutputDidListenersThrowFlag is only used by
Indexed Database API. [INDEXEDDB]
12. Unset event’s in passive listener flag.
13. If global is a Window object, then set global’s current event
to currentEvent.
14. If event’s stop immediate propagation flag is set, then break.
3. Return found.

2.10. Firing events

To fire an event named e at target, optionally using an
eventConstructor, with a description of how IDL attributes are to be
initialized, and a legacy target override flag, run these steps:
1. If eventConstructor is not given, then let eventConstructor be
Event.
2. Let event be the result of creating an event given
eventConstructor, in the relevant realm of target.
3. Initialize event’s type attribute to e.
4. Initialize any other IDL attributes of event as described in the
invocation of this algorithm.
This also allows for the isTrusted attribute to be set to false.
5. Return the result of dispatching event at target, with legacy
target override flag set if set.

Fire in the context of DOM is short for creating, initializing, and
dispatching an event. Fire an event makes that process easier to write
down.

If the event needs its bubbles or cancelable attribute initialized, one
could write "fire an event named submit at target with its cancelable
attribute initialized to true".

Or, when a custom constructor is needed, "fire an event named click at
target using MouseEvent with its detail attribute initialized to 1".

Occasionally the return value is important:
1. Let doAction be the result of firing an event named like at target.
2. If doAction is true, then …

2.11. Action versus occurrence

An event signifies an occurrence, not an action. Phrased differently,
it represents a notification from an algorithm and can be used to
influence the future course of that algorithm (e.g., through invoking
preventDefault()). Events must not be used as actions or initiators
that cause some algorithm to start running. That is not what they are
for.

This is called out here specifically because previous iterations of the
DOM had a concept of "default actions" associated with events that gave
folks all the wrong ideas. Events do not represent or cause actions,
they can only be used to influence an ongoing one.

3. Aborting ongoing activities

Though promises do not have a built-in aborting mechanism, many APIs
using them require abort semantics. AbortController is meant to support
these requirements by providing an abort() method that toggles the
state of a corresponding AbortSignal object. The API which wishes to
support aborting can accept an AbortSignal object, and use its state to
determine how to proceed.

APIs that rely upon AbortController are encouraged to respond to
abort() by rejecting any unsettled promise with the AbortSignal’s abort
reason.

A hypothetical doAmazingness({ ... }) method could accept an
AbortSignal object to support aborting as follows:
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

startSpinner();

doAmazingness({ ..., signal })
.then(result => ...)
.catch(err => {
if (err.name == 'AbortError') return;
showUserErrorMessage();
})
.then(() => stopSpinner());

// …

controller.abort();

doAmazingness could be implemented as follows:
function doAmazingness({signal}) {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
signal.throwIfAborted();

// Begin doing amazingness, and call resolve(result) when done.
// But also, watch for signals:
signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
// Stop doing amazingness, and:
reject(signal.reason);
});
});
}

APIs that do not return promises can either react in an equivalent
manner or opt to not surface the AbortSignal’s abort reason at all.
addEventListener() is an example of an API where the latter made sense.

APIs that require more granular control could extend both
AbortController and AbortSignal objects according to their needs.

3.1. Interface AbortController

[Exposed=*]
interface AbortController {
constructor();

[SameObject] readonly attribute AbortSignal signal;

undefined abort(optional any reason);
};

controller = new AbortController()
Returns a new controller whose signal is set to a newly created
AbortSignal object.

controller . signal
Returns the AbortSignal object associated with this object.

controller . abort(reason)
Invoking this method will store reason in this object’s
AbortSignal’s abort reason, and signal to any observers that the
associated activity is to be aborted. If reason is undefined,
then an "AbortError" DOMException will be stored.

An AbortController object has an associated signal (an AbortSignal
object).

The new AbortController() constructor steps are:
1. Let signal be a new AbortSignal object.
2. Set this’s signal to signal.

The signal getter steps are to return this’s signal.

The abort(reason) method steps are to signal abort on this with reason
if it is given.

To signal abort on an AbortController controller with an optional
reason, signal abort on controller’s signal with reason if it is given.

3.2. Interface AbortSignal

[Exposed=*]
interface AbortSignal : EventTarget {
[NewObject] static AbortSignal abort(optional any reason);
[Exposed=(Window,Worker), NewObject] static AbortSignal timeout([EnforceRange]
unsigned long long milliseconds);
[NewObject] static AbortSignal _any(sequence<AbortSignal> signals);

readonly attribute boolean aborted;
readonly attribute any reason;
undefined throwIfAborted();

attribute EventHandler onabort;
};

AbortSignal . abort(reason)
Returns an AbortSignal instance whose abort reason is set to
reason if not undefined; otherwise to an "AbortError"
DOMException.

AbortSignal . any(signals)
Returns an AbortSignal instance which will be aborted once any
of signals is aborted. Its abort reason will be set to whichever
one of signals caused it to be aborted.

AbortSignal . timeout(milliseconds)
Returns an AbortSignal instance which will be aborted in
milliseconds milliseconds. Its abort reason will be set to a
"TimeoutError" DOMException.

signal . aborted
Returns true if signal’s AbortController has signaled to abort;
otherwise false.

signal . reason
Returns signal’s abort reason.

signal . throwIfAborted()
Throws signal’s abort reason, if signal’s AbortController has
signaled to abort; otherwise, does nothing.

An AbortSignal object has an associated abort reason (a JavaScript
value), which is initially undefined.

An AbortSignal object has associated abort algorithms, (a set of
algorithms which are to be executed when it is aborted), which is
initially empty.

The abort algorithms enable APIs with complex requirements to react in
a reasonable way to abort(). For example, a given API’s abort reason
might need to be propagated to a cross-thread environment, such as a
service worker.

An AbortSignal object has a dependent (a boolean), which is initially
false.

An AbortSignal object has associated source signals (a weak set of
AbortSignal objects that the object is dependent on for its aborted
state), which is initially empty.

An AbortSignal object has associated dependent signals (a weak set of
AbortSignal objects that are dependent on the object for their aborted
state), which is initially empty.
__________________________________________________________________

The static abort(reason) method steps are:
1. Let signal be a new AbortSignal object.
2. Set signal’s abort reason to reason if it is given; otherwise to a
new "AbortError" DOMException.
3. Return signal.

The static timeout(milliseconds) method steps are:
1. Let signal be a new AbortSignal object.
2. Let global be signal’s relevant global object.
3. Run steps after a timeout given global, "AbortSignal-timeout",
milliseconds, and the following step:
1. Queue a global task on the timer task source given global to
signal abort given signal and a new "TimeoutError"
DOMException.
For the duration of this timeout, if signal has any event listeners
registered for its abort event, there must be a strong reference
from global to signal.
4. Return signal.

The static any(signals) method steps are to return the result of
creating a dependent abort signal from signals using AbortSignal and
the current realm.

The aborted getter steps are to return true if this is aborted;
otherwise false.

The reason getter steps are to return this’s abort reason.

The throwIfAborted() method steps are to throw this’s abort reason, if
this is aborted.

This method is primarily useful for when functions accepting
AbortSignals want to throw (or return a rejected promise) at specific
checkpoints, instead of passing along the AbortSignal to other methods.
For example, the following function allows aborting in between each
attempt to poll for a condition. This gives opportunities to abort the
polling process, even though the actual asynchronous operation (i.e.,
await func()) does not accept an AbortSignal.
async function waitForCondition(func, targetValue, { signal } = {}) {
while (true) {
signal?.throwIfAborted();

const result = await func();
if (result === targetValue) {
return;
}
}
}

The onabort attribute is an event handler IDL attribute for the onabort
event handler, whose event handler event type is abort.

Changes to an AbortSignal object represent the wishes of the
corresponding AbortController object, but an API observing the
AbortSignal object can choose to ignore them. For instance, if the
operation has already completed.
__________________________________________________________________

An AbortSignal object is aborted when its abort reason is not
undefined.

To add an algorithm algorithm to an AbortSignal object signal:
1. If signal is aborted, then return.
2. Append algorithm to signal’s abort algorithms.

To remove an algorithm algorithm from an AbortSignal signal, remove
algorithm from signal’s abort algorithms.

To signal abort, given an AbortSignal object signal and an optional
reason:
1. If signal is aborted, then return.
2. Set signal’s abort reason to reason if it is given; otherwise to a

reason.
2. Append dependentSignal to dependentSignalsToAbort.
5. Run the abort steps for signal.
6. For each dependentSignal of dependentSignalsToAbort, run the abort

2. Empty signal’s abort algorithms.
3. Fire an event named abort at signal.

To create a dependent abort signal from a list of AbortSignal objects
signals, using signalInterface, which must be either AbortSignal or an
interface that inherits from it, and a realm:

realm.
2. For each signal of signals: if signal is aborted, then set
resultSignal’s abort reason to signal’s abort reason and return
resultSignal.
3. Set resultSignal’s dependent to true.
4. For each signal of signals:
1. If signal’s dependent is false:
1. Append signal to resultSignal’s source signals.
2. Append resultSignal to signal’s dependent signals.
2. Otherwise, for each sourceSignal of signal’s source signals:
1. Assert: sourceSignal is not aborted and not dependent.
2. Append sourceSignal to resultSignal’s source signals.
3. Append resultSignal to sourceSignal’s dependent signals.
5. Return resultSignal.

3.2.1. Garbage collection

A non-aborted dependent AbortSignal object must not be garbage
collected while its source signals is non-empty and it has registered
event listeners for its abort event or its abort algorithms is
non-empty.

3.3. Using AbortController and AbortSignal objects in APIs

Any web platform API using promises to represent operations that can be
aborted must adhere to the following:
* Accept AbortSignal objects through a signal dictionary member.
* Convey that the operation got aborted by rejecting the promise with
AbortSignal object’s abort reason.
* Reject immediately if the AbortSignal is already aborted,
otherwise:
* Use the abort algorithms mechanism to observe changes to the
AbortSignal object and do so in a manner that does not lead to
clashes with other observers.

The method steps for a promise-returning method doAmazingness(options)
could be as follows:
1. Let global be this’s relevant global object.
2. Let p be a new promise.
3. If options["signal"] exists:
1. Let signal be options["signal"].
2. If signal is aborted, then reject p with signal’s abort reason
and return p.
3. Add the following abort steps to signal:
1. Stop doing amazing things.
2. Reject p with signal’s abort reason.
4. Run these steps in parallel:
1. Let amazingResult be the result of doing some amazing things.
2. Queue a global task on the amazing task source given global to
resolve p with amazingResult.
5. Return p.

APIs not using promises should still adhere to the above as much as
possible.

4. Nodes

4.1. Introduction to "The DOM"

In its original sense, "The DOM" is an API for accessing and
manipulating documents (in particular, HTML and XML documents). In this
specification, the term "document" is used for any markup-based
resource, ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports
with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged interactive
applications.

Each such document is represented as a node tree. Some of the nodes in
a tree can have children, while others are always leaves.

To illustrate, consider this HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class=e>
<head><title>Aliens?</title></head>
<body>Why yes.</body>
</html>

It is represented as follows:
* Document
+ Doctype: html
+ Element: html class="e"
o Element: head
# Element: title
@ Text: Aliens?
o Text: ⏎␣
o Element: body
# Text: Why yes.⏎

Note that, due to the magic that is HTML parsing, not all ASCII
whitespace were turned into Text nodes, but the general concept is
clear. Markup goes in, a tree of nodes comes out.

The most excellent Live DOM Viewer can be used to explore this matter
in more detail.

4.2. Node tree

Nodes are objects that implement Node. Nodes participate in a tree,
which is known as the node tree.

In practice you deal with more specific objects.

Objects that implement Node also implement an inherited interface:
Document, DocumentType, DocumentFragment, Element, CharacterData, or
Attr.

Objects that implement DocumentFragment sometimes implement ShadowRoot.

Objects that implement Element also typically implement an inherited
interface, such as HTMLAnchorElement.

Objects that implement CharacterData also implement an inherited
interface: Text, ProcessingInstruction, or Comment.

Objects that implement Text sometimes implement CDATASection.

Thus, every node’s primary interface is one of: Document, DocumentType,
DocumentFragment, ShadowRoot, Element or an inherited interface of
Element, Attr, Text, CDATASection, ProcessingInstruction, or Comment.

For brevity, this specification refers to an object that implements
Node and an inherited interface NodeInterface, as a NodeInterface node.

A node tree is constrained as follows, expressed as a relationship
between a node and its potential children:

Document
In tree order:

1. Zero or more ProcessingInstruction or Comment nodes.
2. Optionally one DocumentType node.
3. Zero or more ProcessingInstruction or Comment nodes.
4. Optionally one Element node.
5. Zero or more ProcessingInstruction or Comment nodes.

DocumentFragment
Element
Zero or more Element or CharacterData nodes.

DocumentType
CharacterData
Attr
No children.

Attr nodes participate in a tree for historical reasons; they never
have a (non-null) parent or any children and are therefore alone in a
tree.

To determine the length of a node node, run these steps:
1. If node is a DocumentType or Attr node, then return 0.
2. If node is a CharacterData node, then return node’s data’s length.
3. Return the number of node’s children.

A node is considered empty if its length is 0.

4.2.1. Document tree

A document tree is a node tree whose root is a document.

The document element of a document is the element whose parent is that
document, if it exists; otherwise null.

Per the node tree constraints, there can be only one such element.

A node is in a document tree if its root is a document.

A node is in a document if it is in a document tree. The term in a
document is no longer supposed to be used. It indicates that the
standard using it has not been updated to account for shadow trees.

4.2.2. Shadow tree

A shadow tree is a node tree whose root is a shadow root.

A shadow root is always attached to another node tree through its host.
A shadow tree is therefore never alone. The node tree of a shadow
root’s host is sometimes referred to as the light tree.

A shadow tree’s corresponding light tree can be a shadow tree itself.

A node is connected if its shadow-including root is a document.

4.2.2.1. Slots

A shadow tree contains zero or more elements that are slots.

A slot can only be created through HTML’s slot element.

A slot has an associated name (a string). Unless stated otherwise it is
the empty string.

Use these attribute change steps to update a slot’s name:
1. If element is a slot, localName is name, and namespace is null:
1. If value is oldValue, then return.
2. If value is null and oldValue is the empty string, then
return.
3. If value is the empty string and oldValue is null, then
return.
4. If value is null or the empty string, then set element’s name
to the empty string.
5. Otherwise, set element’s name to value.
6. Run assign slottables for a tree with element’s root.

The first slot in a shadow tree, in tree order, whose name is the empty
string, is sometimes known as the "default slot".

A slot has an associated assigned nodes (a list of slottables). Unless
stated otherwise it is empty.

4.2.2.2. Slottables

Element and Text nodes are slottables.

A slot can be a slottable.

A slottable has an associated name (a string). Unless stated otherwise
it is the empty string.

Use these attribute change steps to update a slottable’s name:
1. If localName is slot and namespace is null:
1. If value is oldValue, then return.
2. If value is null and oldValue is the empty string, then
return.
3. If value is the empty string and oldValue is null, then
return.
4. If value is null or the empty string, then set element’s name
to the empty string.
5. Otherwise, set element’s name to value.
6. If element is assigned, then run assign slottables for
element’s assigned slot.
7. Run assign a slot for element.

A slottable has an associated assigned slot (null or a slot). Unless
stated otherwise it is null. A slottable is assigned if its assigned
slot is non-null.

A slottable has an associated manual slot assignment (null or a slot).
Unless stated otherwise, it is null.

A slottable’s manual slot assignment can be implemented using a weak
reference to the slot, because this variable is not directly accessible
from script.

4.2.2.3. Finding slots and slottables

To find a slot for a given slottable slottable and an optional boolean
open (default false):
1. If slottable’s parent is null, then return null.
2. Let shadow be slottable’s parent’s shadow root.
3. If shadow is null, then return null.
4. If open is true and shadow’s mode is not "open", then return null.
5. If shadow’s slot assignment is "manual", then return the slot in
shadow’s descendants whose manually assigned nodes contains
slottable, if any; otherwise null.
6. Return the first slot in tree order in shadow’s descendants whose
name is slottable’s name, if any; otherwise null.

To find slottables for a given slot slot:
1. Let result be « ».
2. Let root be slot’s root.
3. If root is not a shadow root, then return result.
4. Let host be root’s host.
5. If root’s slot assignment is "manual":
1. For each slottable slottable of slot’s manually assigned
nodes, if slottable’s parent is host, append slottable to
result.
6. Otherwise, for each slottable child slottable of host, in tree
order:
1. Let foundSlot be the result of finding a slot given slottable.
2. If foundSlot is slot, then append slottable to result.
7. Return result.

To find flattened slottables for a given slot slot:
1. Let result be « ».
2. If slot’s root is not a shadow root, then return result.
3. Let slottables be the result of finding slottables given slot.
4. If slottables is the empty list, then append each slottable child
of slot, in tree order, to slottables.
5. For each node of slottables:
1. If node is a slot whose root is a shadow root:
1. Let temporaryResult be the result of finding flattened
slottables given node.
2. Append each slottable in temporaryResult, in order, to
result.
2. Otherwise, append node to result.
6. Return result.

4.2.2.4. Assigning slottables and slots

To assign slottables for a slot slot:
1. Let slottables be the result of finding slottables for slot.
2. If slottables and slot’s assigned nodes are not identical, then run
signal a slot change for slot.
3. Set slot’s assigned nodes to slottables.
4. For each slottable of slottables: set slottable’s assigned slot to
slot.

To assign slottables for a tree, given a node root, run assign
slottables for each slot of root’s inclusive descendants, in tree
order.

To assign a slot, given a slottable slottable:
1. Let slot be the result of finding a slot with slottable.
2. If slot is non-null, then run assign slottables for slot.

4.2.2.5. Signaling slot change

Each similar-origin window agent has signal slots (a set of slots),
which is initially empty. [HTML]

To signal a slot change, for a slot slot:
1. Append slot to slot’s relevant agent’s signal slots.
2. Queue a mutation observer microtask.

4.2.3. Mutation algorithms

To ensure pre-insert validity of a node node into a node parent before
null or a node child:
1. If parent is not a Document, DocumentFragment, or Element node,
then throw a "HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
2. If node is a host-including inclusive ancestor of parent, then
throw a "HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
3. If child is non-null and its parent is not parent, then throw a
"NotFoundError" DOMException.
4. If node is not a DocumentFragment, DocumentType, Element, or
CharacterData node, then throw a "HierarchyRequestError"
DOMException.
5. If either node is a Text node and parent is a document, or node is
a doctype and parent is not a document, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
6. If parent is a document, and any of the statements below, switched
on the interface node implements, are true, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.

DocumentFragment
If node has more than one element child or has a Text node
child.

Otherwise, if node has one element child and either parent
has an element child, child is a doctype, or child is
non-null and a doctype is following child.

Element
parent has an element child, child is a doctype, or child
is non-null and a doctype is following child.

DocumentType
parent has a doctype child, child is non-null and an
element is preceding child, or child is null and parent
has an element child.

To pre-insert a node node into a node parent before null or node child:
1. Ensure pre-insert validity of node into parent before child.
2. Let referenceChild be child.
3. If referenceChild is node, then set referenceChild to node’s next
sibling.
4. Insert node into parent before referenceChild.
5. Return node.

Specifications may define insertion steps for all or some nodes. The
algorithm is passed insertedNode, as indicated in the insert algorithm
below. These steps must not modify the node tree that insertedNode
participates in, create browsing contexts, fire events, or otherwise
execute JavaScript. These steps may queue tasks to do these things
asynchronously, however.

While the insertion steps cannot execute JavaScript (among other
things), they will indeed have script-observable consequences. Consider
the below example:
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');

const fragment = new DocumentFragment();
const script = fragment.appendChild(document.createElement('script'));
const style = fragment.appendChild(document.createElement('style'));

script.innerText= 'console.log(getComputedStyle(h1).color)'; // Logs 'rgb(255, 0
, 0)'
style.innerText = 'h1 {color: rgb(255, 0, 0);}';

document.body.append(fragment);

The script in the above example logs 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' because the
following happen in order:
1. The insert algorithm runs, which will insert the script and style
elements in order.
1. The HTML Standard’s insertion steps run for the script
element; they do nothing. [HTML]
2. The HTML Standard’s insertion steps run for the style element;
they immediately apply its style rules to the document. [HTML]
3. The HTML Standard’s post-connection steps run for the script
element; they run the script, which immediately observes the
style rules that were applied in the above step. [HTML]

Specifications may also define post-connection steps for all or some
nodes. The algorithm is passed connectedNode, as indicated in the
insert algorithm below.

The purpose of the post-connection steps is to provide an opportunity
for nodes to perform any connection-related operations that modify the
node tree that connectedNode participates in, create browsing contexts,
or otherwise execute JavaScript. These steps allow a batch of nodes to
be inserted atomically with respect to script, with all major side
effects occurring after the batch insertions into the node tree is
complete. This ensures that all pending node tree insertions completely
finish before more insertions can occur.

Specifications may define children changed steps for all or some nodes.
The algorithm is passed no argument and is called from insert, remove,
and replace data.

To insert a node node into a node parent before null or a node child,
with an optional boolean suppressObservers (default false):
1. Let nodes be node’s children, if node is a DocumentFragment node;
otherwise « node ».
2. Let count be nodes’s size.
3. If count is 0, then return.
4. If node is a DocumentFragment node:
1. Remove its children with suppressObservers set to true.
2. Queue a tree mutation record for node with « », nodes, null,
and null.
This step intentionally does not pay attention to
suppressObservers.
5. If child is non-null:
1. For each live range whose start node is parent and start
offset is greater than child’s index: increase its start
offset by count.
2. For each live range whose end node is parent and end offset is
greater than child’s index: increase its end offset by count.
6. Let previousSibling be child’s previous sibling or parent’s last
child if child is null.
7. For each node in nodes, in tree order:
1. Adopt node into parent’s node document.
2. If child is null, then append node to parent’s children.
3. Otherwise, insert node into parent’s children before child’s
index.
4. If parent is a shadow host whose shadow root’s slot assignment
is "named" and node is a slottable, then assign a slot for
node.
5. If parent’s root is a shadow root, and parent is a slot whose
assigned nodes is the empty list, then run signal a slot
change for parent.
6. Run assign slottables for a tree with node’s root.
7. For each shadow-including inclusive descendant
inclusiveDescendant of node, in shadow-including tree order:
1. Run the insertion steps with inclusiveDescendant.
2. If inclusiveDescendant is not connected, then continue.
3. If inclusiveDescendant is an element and
inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry is
non-null:
1. If inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry’s
is scoped is true, then append inclusiveDescendant’s
node document to inclusiveDescendant’s custom
element registry’s scoped document set.
2. If inclusiveDescendant is custom, then enqueue a
custom element callback reaction with
inclusiveDescendant, callback name
"connectedCallback", and « ».
3. Otherwise, try to upgrade inclusiveDescendant.
If this successfully upgrades inclusiveDescendant,
its connectedCallback will be enqueued automatically
during the upgrade an element algorithm.
4. Otherwise, if inclusiveDescendant is a shadow root,
inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry is
non-null, and inclusiveDescendant’s custom element
registry’s is scoped is true, then append
inclusiveDescendant’s node document to
inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry’s scoped
document set.
8. If suppressObservers is false, then queue a tree mutation record
for parent with nodes, « », previousSibling, and child.
9. Run the children changed steps for parent.
10. Let staticNodeList be a list of nodes, initially « ».
We collect all nodes before calling the post-connection steps on
any one of them, instead of calling the post-connection steps while
we’re traversing the node tree. This is because the post-connection
steps can modify the tree’s structure, making live traversal
unsafe, possibly leading to the post-connection steps being called
multiple times on the same node.
11. For each node of nodes, in tree order:
1. For each shadow-including inclusive descendant
inclusiveDescendant of node, in shadow-including tree order:
append inclusiveDescendant to staticNodeList.
12. For each node of staticNodeList: if node is connected, then run the
post-connection steps with node.

To append a node node to a node parent: pre-insert node into parent
before null.
__________________________________________________________________

Specifications may define moving steps for all or some nodes. The
algorithm is passed a node movedNode, a boolean isSubtreeRoot, and a
node oldAncestor as indicated in the move algorithm below. Like the
insertion steps, these steps must not modify the node tree that
movedNode participates in, create browsing contexts, fire events, or
otherwise execute JavaScript. These steps may queue tasks to do these
things asynchronously, however.

To move a node node into a node newParent before null or a node child:
1. If newParent’s shadow-including root is not the same as node’s
shadow-including root, then throw a "HierarchyRequestError"
DOMException.
This has the side effect of ensuring that a move is only performed
if newParent’s connected is node’s connected.
2. If node is a host-including inclusive ancestor of newParent, then
throw a "HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
3. If child is non-null and its parent is not newParent, then throw a
"NotFoundError" DOMException.
4. If node is not an Element or a CharacterData node, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
5. If node is a Text node and newParent is a document, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
6. If newParent is a document, node is an Element node, and either
newParent has an element child, child is a doctype, or child is
non-null and a doctype is following child then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
7. Let oldParent be node’s parent.
8. Assert: oldParent is non-null.
9. Run the live range pre-remove steps, given node.
10. For each NodeIterator object iterator whose root’s node document is
node’s node document: run the NodeIterator pre-remove steps given
node and iterator.
11. Let oldPreviousSibling be node’s previous sibling.
12. Let oldNextSibling be node’s next sibling.
13. Remove node from oldParent’s children.
14. If node is assigned, then run assign slottables for node’s assigned
slot.
15. If oldParent’s root is a shadow root, and oldParent is a slot whose
assigned nodes is empty, then run signal a slot change for
oldParent.
16. If node has an inclusive descendant that is a slot:
1. Run assign slottables for a tree with oldParent’s root.
2. Run assign slottables for a tree with node.
17. If child is non-null:
1. For each live range whose start node is newParent and start
offset is greater than child’s index: increase its start
offset by 1.
2. For each live range whose end node is newParent and end offset
is greater than child’s index: increase its end offset by 1.
18. Let newPreviousSibling be child’s previous sibling if child is
non-null, and newParent’s last child otherwise.
19. If child is null, then append node to newParent’s children.
20. Otherwise, insert node into newParent’s children before child’s
index.
21. If newParent is a shadow host whose shadow root’s slot assignment
is "named" and node is a slottable, then assign a slot for node.
22. If newParent’s root is a shadow root, and newParent is a slot whose
assigned nodes is empty, then run signal a slot change for
newParent.
23. Run assign slottables for a tree with node’s root.
24. For each shadow-including inclusive descendant inclusiveDescendant
of node, in shadow-including tree order:
1. Let isSubtreeRoot be true if inclusiveDescendant is node;
otherwise false.
2. Run the moving steps with inclusiveDescendant, isSubtreeRoot,
and oldParent.
Because the move algorithm is a separate primitive from insert
and remove, it does not invoke the insertion steps or removing
steps for inclusiveDescendant.
3. If inclusiveDescendant is custom and newParent is connected,
then enqueue a custom element callback reaction with
inclusiveDescendant, callback name "connectedMoveCallback",
and « ».
25. Queue a tree mutation record for oldParent with « », « node »,
oldPreviousSibling, and oldNextSibling.
26. Queue a tree mutation record for newParent with « node », « »,
newPreviousSibling, and child.
__________________________________________________________________

To replace a node child with a node node within a node parent:
1. If parent is not a Document, DocumentFragment, or Element node,
then throw a "HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
2. If node is a host-including inclusive ancestor of parent, then
throw a "HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
3. If child’s parent is not parent, then throw a "NotFoundError"
DOMException.
4. If node is not a DocumentFragment, DocumentType, Element, or
CharacterData node, then throw a "HierarchyRequestError"
DOMException.
5. If either node is a Text node and parent is a document, or node is
a doctype and parent is not a document, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
6. If parent is a document, and any of the statements below, switched
on the interface node implements, are true, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.

DocumentFragment
If node has more than one element child or has a Text node
child.

Otherwise, if node has one element child and either parent
has an element child that is not child or a doctype is
following child.

Element
parent has an element child that is not child or a doctype
is following child.

DocumentType
parent has a doctype child that is not child, or an
element is preceding child.

The above statements differ from the pre-insert algorithm.
7. Let referenceChild be child’s next sibling.
8. If referenceChild is node, then set referenceChild to node’s next
sibling.
9. Let previousSibling be child’s previous sibling.
10. Let removedNodes be the empty set.
11. If child’s parent is non-null:
1. Set removedNodes to « child ».
2. Remove child with suppressObservers set to true.
The above can only be false if child is node.
12. Let nodes be node’s children if node is a DocumentFragment node;
otherwise « node ».
13. Insert node into parent before referenceChild with
suppressObservers set to true.
14. Queue a tree mutation record for parent with nodes, removedNodes,
previousSibling, and referenceChild.
15. Return child.

To replace all with a node or null node within a node parent:
1. Let removedNodes be parent’s children.
2. Let addedNodes be the empty set.
3. If node is a DocumentFragment node, then set addedNodes to node’s
children.
4. Otherwise, if node is non-null, set addedNodes to « node ».
5. Remove all parent’s children, in tree order, with suppressObservers
set to true.
6. If node is non-null, then insert node into parent before null with
suppressObservers set to true.
7. If either addedNodes or removedNodes is not empty, then queue a
tree mutation record for parent with addedNodes, removedNodes,
null, and null.

This algorithm does not make any checks with regards to the node tree
constraints. Specification authors need to use it wisely.
__________________________________________________________________

To pre-remove a node child from a node parent:
1. If child’s parent is not parent, then throw a "NotFoundError"
DOMException.
2. Remove child.
3. Return child.

Specifications may define removing steps for all or some nodes. The
algorithm is passed a node removedNode, a boolean isSubtreeRoot, and a
node oldAncestor as indicated in the remove algorithm below.

To remove a node node, with an optional boolean suppressObservers
(default false):
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. Assert: parent is non-null.
3. Run the live range pre-remove steps, given node.
4. For each NodeIterator object iterator whose root’s node document is
node’s node document: run the NodeIterator pre-remove steps given
node and iterator.
5. Let oldPreviousSibling be node’s previous sibling.
6. Let oldNextSibling be node’s next sibling.
7. Remove node from its parent’s children.
8. If node is assigned, then run assign slottables for node’s assigned
slot.
9. If parent’s root is a shadow root, and parent is a slot whose
assigned nodes is the empty list, then run signal a slot change for
parent.
10. If node has an inclusive descendant that is a slot:
1. Run assign slottables for a tree with parent’s root.
2. Run assign slottables for a tree with node.
11. Run the removing steps with node, true, and parent.
12. Let isParentConnected be parent’s connected.
13. If node is custom and isParentConnected is true, then enqueue a
custom element callback reaction with node, callback name
"disconnectedCallback", and « ».
It is intentional for now that custom elements do not get parent
passed. This might change in the future if there is a need.
14. For each shadow-including descendant descendant of node, in
shadow-including tree order:
1. Run the removing steps with descendant, false, and parent.
2. If descendant is custom and isParentConnected is true, then
enqueue a custom element callback reaction with descendant,
callback name "disconnectedCallback", and « ».
15. For each inclusive ancestor inclusiveAncestor of parent, and then
for each registered of inclusiveAncestor’s registered observer
list, if registered’s options["subtree"] is true, then append a new
transient registered observer whose observer is registered’s
observer, options is registered’s options, and source is registered
to node’s registered observer list.
16. If suppressObservers is false, then queue a tree mutation record
for parent with « », « node », oldPreviousSibling, and
oldNextSibling.
17. Run the children changed steps for parent.

4.2.4. Mixin NonElementParentNode

Web compatibility prevents the getElementById() method from being
exposed on elements (and therefore on ParentNode).
interface mixin NonElementParentNode {
Element? getElementById(DOMString elementId);
};
Document includes NonElementParentNode;
DocumentFragment includes NonElementParentNode;

node . getElementById(elementId)
Returns the first element within node’s descendants whose ID is
elementId.

The getElementById(elementId) method steps are to return the first
element, in tree order, within this’s descendants, whose ID is
elementId; otherwise, if there is no such element, null.

4.2.5. Mixin DocumentOrShadowRoot

interface mixin DocumentOrShadowRoot {
readonly attribute CustomElementRegistry? customElementRegistry;
};
Document includes DocumentOrShadowRoot;
ShadowRoot includes DocumentOrShadowRoot;

registry = documentOrShadowRoot . customElementRegistry
Returns documentOrShadowRoot’s CustomElementRegistry object, if
any; otherwise null.

The customElementRegistry getter steps are:
1. If this is a document, then return this’s custom element registry.
2. Assert: this is a ShadowRoot node.
3. Return this’s custom element registry.

The DocumentOrShadowRoot mixin is also expected to be used by other
standards that want to define APIs shared between documents and shadow
roots.

4.2.6. Mixin ParentNode

To convert nodes into a node, given a list of nodes and strings nodes,
and document document:
1. Replace each string of nodes with a new Text node whose data is the
string and node document is document.
2. If nodes’s size is 1, then return nodes[0].
3. Let fragment be a new DocumentFragment node whose node document is
document.
4. For each node of nodes: append node to fragment.
5. Return fragment.

interface mixin ParentNode {
[SameObject] readonly attribute HTMLCollection children;
readonly attribute Element? firstElementChild;
readonly attribute Element? lastElementChild;
readonly attribute unsigned long childElementCount;

[CEReactions, Unscopable] undefined prepend((Node or DOMString)... nodes);
[CEReactions, Unscopable] undefined append((Node or DOMString)... nodes);

4.2.10. Old-style collections: NodeList and HTMLCollection

A collection is an object that represents a list of nodes. A collection
can be either live or static. Unless otherwise stated, a collection
must be live.

If a collection is live, then the attributes and methods on that object
must operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the data.

When a collection is created, a filter and a root are associated with
it.

The collection then represents a view of the subtree rooted at the
collection’s root, containing only nodes that match the given filter.
The view is linear. In the absence of specific requirements to the
contrary, the nodes within the collection must be sorted in tree order.

4.2.10.1. Interface NodeList

A NodeList object is a collection of nodes.
[Exposed=Window]
interface NodeList {
getter Node? item(unsigned long index);
readonly attribute unsigned long length;
iterable<Node>;
};

collection . length
Returns the number of nodes in the collection.

element = collection . item(index)
element = collection[index]
Returns the node with index index from the collection. The nodes
are sorted in tree order.

The object’s supported property indices are the numbers in the range
zero to one less than the number of nodes represented by the
collection. If there are no such elements, then there are no supported
property indices.

The length attribute must return the number of nodes represented by the
collection.

The item(index) method must return the index^th node in the collection.
If there is no index^th node in the collection, then the method must
return null.

4.2.10.2. Interface HTMLCollection

[Exposed=Window, LegacyUnenumerableNamedProperties]
interface HTMLCollection {
readonly attribute unsigned long length;
getter Element? item(unsigned long index);
getter Element? namedItem(DOMString name);
};

An HTMLCollection object is a collection of elements.

HTMLCollection is a historical artifact we cannot rid the web of. While
developers are of course welcome to keep using it, new API standard
designers ought not to use it (use sequence<T> in IDL instead).

collection . length
Returns the number of elements in the collection.

element = collection . item(index)
element = collection[index]
Returns the element with index index from the collection. The
elements are sorted in tree order.

element = collection . namedItem(name)
element = collection[name]
Returns the first element with ID or name name from the
collection.

The object’s supported property indices are the numbers in the range
zero to one less than the number of elements represented by the
collection. If there are no such elements, then there are no supported
property indices.

The length getter steps are to return the number of nodes represented
by the collection.

The item(index) method steps are to return the index^th element in the
collection. If there is no index^th element in the collection, then the
method must return null.

The supported property names are the values from the list returned by
these steps:
1. Let result be an empty list.
2. For each element represented by the collection, in tree order:
1. If element has an ID which is not in result, append element’s
ID to result.
2. If element is in the HTML namespace and has a name attribute
whose value is neither the empty string nor is in result,
append element’s name attribute value to result.
3. Return result.

The namedItem(key) method steps are:
1. If key is the empty string, return null.
2. Return the first element in the collection for which at least one
of the following is true:
+ it has an ID which is key;
+ it is in the HTML namespace and has a name attribute whose
value is key;
or null if there is no such element.

4.3. Mutation observers

Each similar-origin window agent has a mutation observer microtask
queued (a boolean), which is initially false. [HTML]

Each similar-origin window agent also has pending mutation observers (a
set of zero or more MutationObserver objects), which is initially
empty.

To queue a mutation observer microtask:
1. If the surrounding agent’s mutation observer microtask queued is
true, then return.
2. Set the surrounding agent’s mutation observer microtask queued to
true.
3. Queue a microtask to notify mutation observers.

To notify mutation observers:
1. Set the surrounding agent’s mutation observer microtask queued to
false.
2. Let notifySet be a clone of the surrounding agent’s pending
mutation observers.
3. Empty the surrounding agent’s pending mutation observers.
4. Let signalSet be a clone of the surrounding agent’s signal slots.
5. Empty the surrounding agent’s signal slots.
6. For each mo of notifySet:
1. Let records be a clone of mo’s record queue.
2. Empty mo’s record queue.
3. For each node of mo’s node list: remove all transient
registered observers whose observer is mo from node’s
registered observer list.
4. If records is not empty, then invoke mo’s callback with «
records, mo » and "report", and with callback this value mo.
7. For each slot of signalSet: fire an event named slotchange, with
its bubbles attribute set to true, at slot.
__________________________________________________________________

Each node has a registered observer list (a list of zero or more
registered observers), which is initially empty.

A registered observer consists of an observer (a MutationObserver
object) and options (a MutationObserverInit dictionary).

A transient registered observer is a registered observer that also
consists of a source (a registered observer).

Transient registered observers are used to track mutations within a
given node’s descendants after node has been removed so they do not get
lost when subtree is set to true on node’s parent.

4.3.1. Interface MutationObserver

[Exposed=Window]
interface MutationObserver {
constructor(MutationCallback callback);

undefined observe(Node target, optional MutationObserverInit options = {});
undefined disconnect();
sequence<MutationRecord> takeRecords();
};

callback MutationCallback = undefined (sequence<MutationRecord> mutations, Mutat
ionObserver observer);

dictionary MutationObserverInit {
boolean childList = false;
boolean attributes;
boolean characterData;
boolean subtree = false;
boolean attributeOldValue;
boolean characterDataOldValue;
sequence<DOMString> attributeFilter;
};

A MutationObserver object can be used to observe mutations to the tree
of nodes.

Each MutationObserver object has these associated concepts:
* A callback set on creation.
* A node list (a list of weak references to nodes), which is
initially empty.
* A record queue (a queue of zero or more MutationRecord objects),
which is initially empty.

observer = new MutationObserver(callback)
Constructs a MutationObserver object and sets its callback to
callback. The callback is invoked with a list of MutationRecord
objects as first argument and the constructed MutationObserver
object as second argument. It is invoked after nodes registered
with the observe() method, are mutated.

observer . observe(target, options)
Instructs the user agent to observe a given target (a node) and
report any mutations based on the criteria given by options (an
object).

The options argument allows for setting mutation observation
options via object members. These are the object members that
can be used:

childList
Set to true if mutations to target’s children are to be
observed.

attributes
Set to true if mutations to target’s attributes are to be
observed. Can be omitted if attributeOldValue or
attributeFilter is specified.

characterData
Set to true if mutations to target’s data are to be
observed. Can be omitted if characterDataOldValue is
specified.

subtree
Set to true if mutations to not just target, but also
target’s descendants are to be observed.

attributeOldValue
Set to true if attributes is true or omitted and target’s
attribute value before the mutation needs to be recorded.

characterDataOldValue
Set to true if characterData is set to true or omitted and
target’s data before the mutation needs to be recorded.

attributeFilter
Set to a list of attribute local names (without namespace)
if not all attribute mutations need to be observed and
attributes is true or omitted.

observer . disconnect()
Stops observer from observing any mutations. Until the observe()
method is used again, observer’s callback will not be invoked.

observer . takeRecords()
Empties the record queue and returns what was in there.

The new MutationObserver(callback) constructor steps are to set this’s
callback to callback.

The observe(target, options) method steps are:
1. If either options["attributeOldValue"] or
options["attributeFilter"] exists, and options["attributes"] does
not exist, then set options["attributes"] to true.
2. If options["characterDataOldValue"] exists and
options["characterData"] does not exist, then set
options["characterData"] to true.
3. If none of options["childList"], options["attributes"], and
options["characterData"] is true, then throw a TypeError.
4. If options["attributeOldValue"] is true and options["attributes"]
is false, then throw a TypeError.
5. If options["attributeFilter"] is present and options["attributes"]
is false, then throw a TypeError.
6. If options["characterDataOldValue"] is true and
options["characterData"] is false, then throw a TypeError.
7. For each registered of target’s registered observer list: if
registered’s observer is this:
1. For each node of this’s node list: remove all transient
registered observers whose source is registered from node’s
registered observer list.
2. Set registered’s options to options.
8. Otherwise:
1. Append a new registered observer whose observer is this and
options is options to target’s registered observer list.
2. Append a weak reference to target to this’s node list.

The disconnect() method steps are:
1. For each node of this’s node list: remove any registered observer
from node’s registered observer list for which this is the
observer.
2. Empty this’s record queue.

The takeRecords() method steps are:
1. Let records be a clone of this’s record queue.
2. Empty this’s record queue.
3. Return records.

4.3.2. Queuing a mutation record

To queue a mutation record of type for target with name, namespace,
oldValue, addedNodes, removedNodes, previousSibling, and nextSibling:
1. Let interestedObservers be an empty map.
2. Let nodes be the inclusive ancestors of target.
3. For each node of nodes, and then for each registered of node’s
registered observer list:
1. Let options be registered’s options.
2. If none of the following are true
o node is not target and options["subtree"] is false
o type is "attributes" and options["attributes"] either
does not exist or is false
o type is "attributes", options["attributeFilter"] exists,
and options["attributeFilter"] does not contain name or
namespace is non-null
o type is "characterData" and options["characterData"]
either does not exist or is false
o type is "childList" and options["childList"] is false
then:
1. Let mo be registered’s observer.
2. If interestedObservers[mo] does not exist, then set
interestedObservers[mo] to null.
3. If either type is "attributes" and
options["attributeOldValue"] is true, or type is
"characterData" and options["characterDataOldValue"] is
true, then set interestedObservers[mo] to oldValue.
4. For each observer → mappedOldValue of interestedObservers:
1. Let record be a new MutationRecord object with its type set to
type, target set to target, attributeName set to name,
attributeNamespace set to namespace, oldValue set to
mappedOldValue, addedNodes set to addedNodes, removedNodes set
to removedNodes, previousSibling set to previousSibling, and
nextSibling set to nextSibling.
2. Enqueue record to observer’s record queue.
3. Append observer to the surrounding agent’s pending mutation
observers.
5. Queue a mutation observer microtask.

To queue a tree mutation record for target with addedNodes,
removedNodes, previousSibling, and nextSibling:
1. Assert: either addedNodes or removedNodes is not empty.
2. Queue a mutation record of "childList" for target with null, null,
null, addedNodes, removedNodes, previousSibling, and nextSibling.

4.3.3. Interface MutationRecord

[Exposed=Window]
interface MutationRecord {
readonly attribute DOMString type;
[SameObject] readonly attribute Node target;
[SameObject] readonly attribute NodeList addedNodes;
[SameObject] readonly attribute NodeList removedNodes;
readonly attribute Node? previousSibling;
readonly attribute Node? nextSibling;
readonly attribute DOMString? attributeName;
readonly attribute DOMString? attributeNamespace;
readonly attribute DOMString? oldValue;
};

record . type
Returns "attributes" if it was an attribute mutation.
"characterData" if it was a mutation to a CharacterData node.
And "childList" if it was a mutation to the tree of nodes.

record . target
Returns the node the mutation affected, depending on the type.
For "attributes", it is the element whose attribute changed. For
"characterData", it is the CharacterData node. For "childList",
it is the node whose children changed.

record . addedNodes
record . removedNodes
Return the nodes added and removed respectively.

record . previousSibling
record . nextSibling
Return the previous and next sibling respectively of the added
or removed nodes; otherwise null.

record . attributeName
Returns the local name of the changed attribute; otherwise null.

record . attributeNamespace
Returns the namespace of the changed attribute; otherwise null.

record . oldValue
The return value depends on type. For "attributes", it is the
value of the changed attribute before the change. For
"characterData", it is the data of the changed node before the
change. For "childList", it is null.

The type, target, addedNodes, removedNodes, previousSibling,
nextSibling, attributeName, attributeNamespace, and oldValue attributes
must return the values they were initialized to.

Node is an abstract interface that is used by all nodes. You cannot get
a direct instance of it.

Each node has an associated node document, set upon creation, that is a
document.

A node’s node document can be changed by the adopt algorithm.

A node’s get the parent algorithm, given an event, returns the node’s
assigned slot, if node is assigned; otherwise node’s parent.

Each node also has a registered observer list.

algorithm is passed node, copy, and subtree as indicated in the clone a
node algorithm.

HTML defines cloning steps for several elements, such as input, script,
and template. SVG ought to do the same for its script elements, but
does not.

To clone a node given a node node and an optional document document
(default node’s node document), boolean subtree (default false),
node-or-null parent (default null), and null or a CustomElementRegistry
object fallbackRegistry (default null):
1. Assert: node is not a document or node is document.
2. Let copy be the result of cloning a single node given node,
document, and fallbackRegistry.
3. Run any cloning steps defined for node in other applicable
specifications and pass node, copy, and subtree as parameters.
4. If parent is non-null, then append copy to parent.
5. If subtree is true, then for each child of node’s children, in tree
order: clone a node given child with document set to document,
subtree set to subtree, parent set to copy, and fallbackRegistry
set to fallbackRegistry.
6. If node is an element, node is a shadow host, and node’s shadow
root’s clonable is true:
1. Assert: copy is not a shadow host.
2. Let shadowRootRegistry be node’s shadow root’s custom element
registry.
3. If shadowRootRegistry is a global custom element registry,
then set shadowRootRegistry to document’s effective global
custom element registry.
4. Attach a shadow root with copy, node’s shadow root’s mode,
true, node’s shadow root’s serializable, node’s shadow root’s
delegates focus, node’s shadow root’s slot assignment, and
shadowRootRegistry.
5. Set copy’s shadow root’s declarative to node’s shadow root’s
declarative.
6. Set copy’s shadow root’s keep custom element registry null to
node’s shadow root’s keep custom element registry null.
7. For each child of node’s shadow root’s children, in tree
order: clone a node given child with document set to document,
subtree set to subtree, and parent set to copy’s shadow root.
This intentionally does not pass the fallbackRegistry
argument.
7. Return copy.

To clone a single node given a node node, document document, and null
or a CustomElementRegistry object fallbackRegistry:
1. Let copy be null.
2. If node is an element:
1. Let registry be node’s custom element registry.
2. If registry is null, then set registry to fallbackRegistry.
3. If registry is a global custom element registry, then set
registry to document’s effective global custom element
registry.
4. Set copy to the result of creating an element, given document,
node’s local name, node’s namespace, node’s namespace prefix,
node’s is value, false, and registry.
5. For each attribute of node’s attribute list:
1. Let copyAttribute be the result of cloning a single node
given attribute, document, and null.
2. Append copyAttribute to copy.
3. Otherwise, set copy to a node that implements the same interfaces
as node, and fulfills these additional requirements, switching on
the interface node implements:

Document

1. Set copy’s encoding, content type, URL, origin, type,
mode, and allow declarative shadow roots, to those of
node.
2. If node’s custom element registry’s is scoped is true,
then set copy’s custom element registry to node’s custom
element registry.

DocumentType
Set copy’s name, public ID, and system ID to those of
node.

Attr
Set copy’s namespace, namespace prefix, local name, and
value to those of node.

Text
Comment
Set copy’s data to that of node.

ProcessingInstruction
Set copy’s target and data to those of node.

Otherwise
Do nothing.

4. Assert: copy is a node.
5. If node is a document, then set document to copy.
6. Set copy’s node document to document.
7. Return copy.

The cloneNode(subtree) method steps are:
1. If this is a shadow root, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
2. Return the result of cloning a node given this with subtree set to
subtree.

A node A equals a node B if all of the following conditions are true:
* A and B implement the same interfaces.
* The following are equal, switching on the interface A implements:

DocumentType
Its name, public ID, and system ID.

Element
Its namespace, namespace prefix, local name, and its
attribute list’s size.

Attr
Its namespace, local name, and value.

ProcessingInstruction
Its target and data.

Text
Comment
Its data.

Otherwise
—

* If A is an element, each attribute in its attribute list equals an
attribute in B’s attribute list.
* A and B have the same number of children.
* Each child of A equals the child of B at the identical index.

The isEqualNode(otherNode) method steps are to return true if otherNode
is non-null and this equals otherNode; otherwise false.

The isSameNode(otherNode) method steps are to return true if otherNode
is this; otherwise false.
__________________________________________________________________

node . compareDocumentPosition(other)
Returns a bitmask indicating the position of other relative to
node. These are the bits that can be set:

Node . DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED (1)
Set when node and other are not in the same tree.

Node . DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING (2)
Set when other is preceding node.

Node . DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING (4)
Set when other is following node.

Node . DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS (8)
Set when other is an ancestor of node.

Node . DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY (16, 10 in hexadecimal)
Set when other is a descendant of node.

node . contains(other)
Returns true if other is an inclusive descendant of node;
otherwise false.

These are the constants compareDocumentPosition() returns as mask:
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED (1);
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING (2);
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING (4);
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS (8);
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY (16, 10 in hexadecimal);
* DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC (32, 20 in hexadecimal).

The compareDocumentPosition(other) method steps are:
1. If this is other, then return zero.
2. Let node1 be other and node2 be this.
3. Let attr1 and attr2 be null.
4. If node1 is an attribute, then set attr1 to node1 and node1 to
attr1’s element.
5. If node2 is an attribute:
1. Set attr2 to node2 and node2 to attr2’s element.
2. If attr1 and node1 are non-null, and node2 is node1:
1. For each attr of node2’s attribute list:
1. If attr equals attr1, then return the result of
adding DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC and
DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING.
2. If attr equals attr2, then return the result of
adding DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC and
DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING.
6. If node1 or node2 is null, or node1’s root is not node2’s root,
then return the result of adding DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED,
DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC, and either
DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING or DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING, with
the constraint that this is to be consistent, together.
Whether to return DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING or
DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING is typically implemented via pointer
comparison. In JavaScript implementations a cached Math.random()
value can be used.
7. If node1 is an ancestor of node2 and attr1 is null, or node1 is
node2 and attr2 is non-null, then return the result of adding
DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS to DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING.
8. If node1 is a descendant of node2 and attr2 is null, or node1 is
node2 and attr1 is non-null, then return the result of adding
DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY to DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING.
9. If node1 is preceding node2, then return
DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING.
Due to the way attributes are handled in this algorithm this
results in a node’s attributes counting as preceding that node’s
children, despite attributes not participating in the same tree.
10. Return DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING.

The contains(other) method steps are to return true if other is an
inclusive descendant of this; otherwise false (including when other is
null).

steps:
1. If element’s namespace is namespace and its namespace prefix is

The list of elements with qualified name qualifiedName for a node root
is the HTMLCollection returned by the following algorithm:
1. If qualifiedName is U+002A (*), then return an HTMLCollection
rooted at root, whose filter matches only descendant elements.
2. Otherwise, if root’s node document is an HTML document, return an
HTMLCollection rooted at root, whose filter matches the following
descendant elements:
+ Whose namespace is the HTML namespace and whose qualified name
is qualifiedName, in ASCII lowercase.
+ Whose namespace is not the HTML namespace and whose qualified
name is qualifiedName.
3. Otherwise, return an HTMLCollection rooted at root, whose filter
matches descendant elements whose qualified name is qualifiedName.

When invoked with the same argument, and as long as root’s node
document’s type has not changed, the same HTMLCollection object may be
returned as returned by an earlier call.

The list of elements with namespace namespace and local name localName
for a node root is the HTMLCollection returned by the following
algorithm:

HTMLCollection rooted at root, whose filter matches descendant
elements.
3. If namespace is U+002A (*), then return an HTMLCollection rooted at
root, whose filter matches descendant elements whose local name is
localName.
4. If localName is U+002A (*), then return an HTMLCollection rooted at
root, whose filter matches descendant elements whose namespace is
namespace.
5. Return an HTMLCollection rooted at root, whose filter matches
descendant elements whose namespace is namespace and local name is
localName.

When invoked with the same arguments, the same HTMLCollection object
may be returned as returned by an earlier call.

The list of elements with class names classNames for a node root is the
HTMLCollection returned by the following algorithm:
1. Let classes be the result of running the ordered set parser on
classNames.
2. If classes is the empty set, return an empty HTMLCollection.
3. Return an HTMLCollection rooted at root, whose filter matches
descendant elements that have all their classes in classes.
The comparisons for the classes must be done in an ASCII
case-insensitive manner if root’s node document’s mode is "quirks";
otherwise in an identical to manner.

When invoked with the same argument, the same HTMLCollection object may
be returned as returned by an earlier call.

Document nodes are simply known as documents.

A document’s node document is itself.

Each document has an associated encoding (an encoding), content type (a
string), URL (a URL), origin (an origin), type ("xml" or "html"), mode
("no-quirks", "quirks", or "limited-quirks"), allow declarative shadow
roots (a boolean), and custom element registry (null or a
CustomElementRegistry object). [ENCODING] [URL] [HTML]

Unless stated otherwise, a document’s encoding is the utf-8 encoding,
content type is "application/xml", URL is "about:blank", origin is an
opaque origin, type is "xml", mode is "no-quirks", allow declarative
shadow roots is false, and custom element registry is null.

A document is said to be an XML document if its type is "xml";
otherwise an HTML document. Whether a document is an HTML document or
an XML document affects the behavior of certain APIs.

A document is said to be in no-quirks mode if its mode is "no-quirks",
quirks mode if its mode is "quirks", and limited-quirks mode if its
mode is "limited-quirks".

The mode is only ever changed from the default for documents created by
the HTML parser based on the presence, absence, or value of the DOCTYPE
string, and by a new browsing context (initial "about:blank"). [HTML]

No-quirks mode was originally known as "standards mode" and
limited-quirks mode was once known as "almost standards mode". They
have been renamed because their details are now defined by standards.
(And because Ian Hickson vetoed their original names on the basis that
they are nonsensical.)

A document’s get the parent algorithm, given an event, returns null if
event’s type attribute value is "load" or document does not have a
browsing context; otherwise the document’s relevant global object.
__________________________________________________________________

document = new Document()
Returns a new document.

document . implementation
Returns document’s DOMImplementation object.

document . URL
document . documentURI
Returns document’s URL.

document . compatMode
Returns the string "BackCompat" if document’s mode is "quirks";
otherwise "CSS1Compat".

document . characterSet
Returns document’s encoding.

document . contentType
Returns document’s content type.

The new Document() constructor steps are to set this’s origin to the
origin of current global object’s associated Document. [HTML]

Unlike createDocument(), this constructor does not return an
XMLDocument object, but a document (Document object).

The implementation getter steps are to return the DOMImplementation
object that is associated with this.

The URL and documentURI getter steps are to return this’s URL,
serialized.

The compatMode getter steps are to return "BackCompat" if this’s mode
is "quirks"; otherwise "CSS1Compat".

The characterSet, charset, and inputEncoding getter steps are to return
this’s encoding’s name.

The contentType getter steps are to return this’s content type.
__________________________________________________________________

document . doctype
Returns the doctype or null if there is none.

document . documentElement
Returns the document element.

collection = document . getElementsByTagName(qualifiedName)
If qualifiedName is "*" returns an HTMLCollection of all
descendant elements.

Otherwise, returns an HTMLCollection of all descendant elements
whose qualified name is qualifiedName. (Matches
case-insensitively against elements in the HTML namespace within
an HTML document.)

collection = document . getElementsByTagNameNS(namespace, localName)
If namespace and localName are "*", returns an HTMLCollection of
all descendant elements.

If only namespace is "*", returns an HTMLCollection of all
descendant elements whose local name is localName.

If only localName is "*", returns an HTMLCollection of all
descendant elements whose namespace is namespace.

Otherwise, returns an HTMLCollection of all descendant elements
whose namespace is namespace and local name is localName.

collection = document . getElementsByClassName(classNames)
collection = element . getElementsByClassName(classNames)
Returns an HTMLCollection of the elements in the object on which
the method was invoked (a document or an element) that have all
the classes given by classNames. The classNames argument is
interpreted as a space-separated list of classes.

The doctype getter steps are to return the child of this that is a
doctype; otherwise null.

The documentElement getter steps are to return this’s document element.

The getElementsByTagName(qualifiedName) method steps are to return the
list of elements with qualified name qualifiedName for this.

Thus, in an HTML document, document.getElementsByTagName("FOO") will
match <FOO> elements that are not in the HTML namespace, and <foo>
elements that are in the HTML namespace, but not <FOO> elements that
are in the HTML namespace.

The getElementsByTagNameNS(namespace, localName) method steps are to
return the list of elements with namespace namespace and local name
localName for this.

The getElementsByClassName(classNames) method steps are to return the
list of elements with class names classNames for this.

Given the following XHTML fragment:
<div id="example">
<p id="p1" class="aaa bbb"/>
<p id="p2" class="aaa ccc"/>
<p id="p3" class="bbb ccc"/>
</div>

A call to
document.getElementById("example").getElementsByClassName("aaa") would
return an HTMLCollection with the two paragraphs p1 and p2 in it.

A call to getElementsByClassName("ccc bbb") would only return one node,
however, namely p3. A call to
document.getElementById("example").getElementsByClassName("bbb ccc ")
would return the same thing.

A call to getElementsByClassName("aaa,bbb") would return no nodes; none
of the elements above are in the aaa,bbb class.
__________________________________________________________________

element = document . createElement(localName [, options])
Returns an element with localName as local name (if document is
an HTML document, localName gets lowercased). The element’s
namespace is the HTML namespace when document is an HTML
document or document’s content type is "application/xhtml+xml";
otherwise null.

When supplied, options’s customElementRegistry can be used to
set the CustomElementRegistry.

When supplied, options’s is can be used to create a customized
built-in element.

If localName is not a valid element local name an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException will be thrown.

When both options’s customElementRegistry and options’s is are
supplied, a "NotSupportedError" DOMException will be thrown.

element = document . createElementNS(namespace, qualifiedName [,
options])
Returns an element with namespace namespace. Its namespace
prefix will be everything before U+003A (:) in qualifiedName or
null. Its local name will be everything after U+003A (:) in
qualifiedName or qualifiedName.

When supplied, options’s customElementRegistry can be used to
set the CustomElementRegistry.

When supplied, options’s is can be used to create a customized
built-in element.

If qualifiedName is not a (possibly-prefixed) valid element
local name an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException will be
thrown.

If one of the following conditions is true a "NamespaceError"
DOMException will be thrown:

+ Namespace prefix is non-null and namespace is the empty
string.
+ Namespace prefix is "xml" and namespace is not the XML
namespace.
+ qualifiedName or namespace prefix is "xmlns" and namespace is
not the XMLNS namespace.
+ namespace is the XMLNS namespace and neither qualifiedName nor
namespace prefix is "xmlns".

When both options’s customElementRegistry and options’s is are
supplied, a "NotSupportedError" DOMException will be thrown.

documentFragment = document . createDocumentFragment()
Returns a DocumentFragment node.

text = document . createTextNode(data)
Returns a Text node whose data is data.

text = document . createCDATASection(data)
Returns a CDATASection node whose data is data.

comment = document . createComment(data)
Returns a Comment node whose data is data.

processingInstruction = document . createProcessingInstruction(target,
data)
Returns a ProcessingInstruction node whose target is target and
data is data. If target does not match the Name production an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException will be thrown. If data
contains "?>" an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException will be
thrown.

The element interface for any name and namespace is Element, unless
stated otherwise.

The HTML Standard will, e.g., define that for html and the HTML
namespace, the HTMLHtmlElement interface is used. [HTML]

The createElement(localName, options) method steps are:
1. If localName is not a valid element local name, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
2. If this is an HTML document, then set localName to localName in
ASCII lowercase.
3. Let registry and is be the result of flattening element creation
options given options and this.
4. Let namespace be the HTML namespace, if this is an HTML document or
this’s content type is "application/xhtml+xml"; otherwise null.
5. Return the result of creating an element given this, localName,
namespace, null, is, true, and registry.

The internal createElementNS steps, given document, namespace,
qualifiedName, and options, are as follows:
1. Let (namespace, prefix, localName) be the result of validating and
extracting namespace and qualifiedName given "element".
2. Let registry and is be the result of flattening element creation
options given options and this.
3. Return the result of creating an element given document, localName,
namespace, prefix, is, true, and registry.

The createElementNS(namespace, qualifiedName, options) method steps are
to return the result of running the internal createElementNS steps,
given this, namespace, qualifiedName, and options.

To flatten element creation options, given a string or
ElementCreationOptions dictionary options and a document document:
1. Let registry be the result of looking up a custom element registry
given document.
2. Let is be null.
3. If options is a dictionary:
1. If options["is"] exists, then set is to it.
2. If options["customElementRegistry"] exists:
1. If is is non-null, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
2. Set registry to options["customElementRegistry"].
3. If registry is non-null, registry’s is scoped is false, and
registry is not document’s custom element registry, then throw
a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.
4. Return registry and is.

createElement() and createElementNS()’s options parameter is allowed to
be a string for web compatibility.

The createDocumentFragment() method steps are to return a new
DocumentFragment node whose node document is this.

The createTextNode(data) method steps are to return a new Text node
whose data is data and node document is this.

The createCDATASection(data) method steps are:
1. If this is an HTML document, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.

"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
3. Return a new ProcessingInstruction node, with target set to target,
data set to data, and node document set to this.
__________________________________________________________________

clone = document . importNode(node [, options = false])
Returns a copy of node. If options is true or options is a
dictionary whose selfOnly is false, the copy also includes the
node’s descendants.

options’s customElementRegistry can be used to set the
CustomElementRegistry of elements that have none.

If node is a document or a shadow root, throws a
"NotSupportedError" DOMException.

node = document . adoptNode(node)
Moves node from another document and returns it.

If node is a document, throws a "NotSupportedError" DOMException
or, if node is a shadow root, throws a "HierarchyRequestError"
DOMException.

The importNode(node, options) method steps are:
1. If node is a document or shadow root, then throw a
"NotSupportedError" DOMException.
2. Let subtree be false.
3. Let registry be null.
4. If options is a boolean, then set subtree to options.
5. Otherwise:
1. Set subtree to the negation of options["selfOnly"].
2. If options["customElementRegistry"] exists, then set registry
to it.
3. If registry’s is scoped is false and registry is not this’s
custom element registry, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
6. If registry is null, then set registry to the result of looking up
a custom element registry given this.
7. Return the result of cloning a node given node with document set to
this, subtree set to subtree, and fallbackRegistry set to registry.

Specifications may define adopting steps for all or some nodes. The
algorithm is passed node and oldDocument, as indicated in the adopt
algorithm.

To adopt a node node into a document document:
1. Let oldDocument be node’s node document.
2. If node’s parent is non-null, then remove node.
3. If document is not oldDocument:
1. For each inclusiveDescendant of node’s shadow-including
inclusive descendants, in shadow-including tree order:
1. Set inclusiveDescendant’s node document to document.
2. If inclusiveDescendant is a shadow root and if any of the
following are true:
# inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry is
null and inclusiveDescendant’s keep custom element
registry null is false; or
# inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry is a
global custom element registry,
then set inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry to
document’s effective global custom element registry.
3. Otherwise, if inclusiveDescendant is an element:
1. Set the node document of each attribute in
inclusiveDescendant’s attribute list to document.
2. If inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry is
null or inclusiveDescendant’s custom element
registry’s is scoped is false, then set
inclusiveDescendant’s custom element registry to
document’s effective global custom element registry.
2. For each inclusiveDescendant of node’s shadow-including
inclusive descendants that is custom, in shadow-including tree
order: enqueue a custom element callback reaction with
inclusiveDescendant, callback name "adoptedCallback", and «
oldDocument, document ».
3. For each inclusiveDescendant of node’s shadow-including
inclusive descendants, in shadow-including tree order: run the
adopting steps with inclusiveDescendant and oldDocument.

The adoptNode(node) method steps are:
1. If node is a document, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
2. If node is a shadow root, then throw a "HierarchyRequestError"
DOMException.
3. If node is a DocumentFragment node whose host is non-null, then
return.
4. Adopt node into this.
5. Return node.
__________________________________________________________________

Null or a CustomElementRegistry object registry is a global custom
element registry if registry is non-null and registry’s is scoped is
false.

A document document’s effective global custom element registry is:
1. If document’s custom element registry is a global custom element
registry, then return document’s custom element registry.
2. Return null.
__________________________________________________________________

The createAttribute(localName) method steps are:
1. If localName is not a valid attribute local name, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
2. If this is an HTML document, then set localName to localName in
ASCII lowercase.
3. Return a new attribute whose local name is localName and node
document is this.

The createAttributeNS(namespace, qualifiedName) method steps are:
1. Let (namespace, prefix, localName) be the result of validating and
extracting namespace and qualifiedName given "attribute".
2. Return a new attribute whose namespace is namespace, namespace
prefix is prefix, local name is localName, and node document is
this.
__________________________________________________________________

The createEvent(interface) method steps are:
1. Let constructor be null.
2. If interface is an ASCII case-insensitive match for any of the
strings in the first column in the following table, then set
constructor to the interface in the second column on the same row
as the matching string:

String Interface Notes
"beforeunloadevent" BeforeUnloadEvent [HTML]
"compositionevent" CompositionEvent [UIEVENTS]
"customevent" CustomEvent
"devicemotionevent" DeviceMotionEvent [DEVICE-ORIENTATION]
"deviceorientationevent" DeviceOrientationEvent
"dragevent" DragEvent [HTML]
"event" Event
"events"
"focusevent" FocusEvent [UIEVENTS]
"hashchangeevent" HashChangeEvent [HTML]
"htmlevents" Event

"uievents"
3. If constructor is null, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
4. If the interface indicated by constructor is not exposed on the
relevant global object of this, then throw a "NotSupportedError"
DOMException.
Typically user agents disable support for touch events in some
configurations, in which case this clause would be triggered for
the interface TouchEvent.
5. Let event be the result of creating an event given constructor.
6. Initialize event’s type attribute to the empty string.
7. Initialize event’s timeStamp attribute to the result of calling
current high resolution time with this’s relevant global object.
8. Initialize event’s isTrusted attribute to false.
9. Unset event’s initialized flag.
10. Return event.

Event constructors ought to be used instead.
__________________________________________________________________

The createRange() method steps are to return a new live range with
(this, 0) as its start an end.

The Range() constructor can be used instead.
__________________________________________________________________

The createNodeIterator(root, whatToShow, filter) method steps are:
1. Let iterator be a new NodeIterator object.
2. Set iterator’s root and iterator’s reference to root.
3. Set iterator’s pointer before reference to true.
4. Set iterator’s whatToShow to whatToShow.

2. Set walker’s root and walker’s current to root.
3. Set walker’s whatToShow to whatToShow.
4. Set walker’s filter to filter.
5. Return walker.

4.5.1. Interface DOMImplementation

User agents must create a DOMImplementation object whenever a document
is created and associate it with that document.
[Exposed=Window]
interface DOMImplementation {
[NewObject] DocumentType createDocumentType(DOMString name, DOMString publicId
, DOMString systemId);
[NewObject] XMLDocument createDocument(DOMString? namespace, [LegacyNullToEmpt
yString] DOMString qualifiedName, optional DocumentType? doctype = null);
[NewObject] Document createHTMLDocument(optional DOMString title);

boolean hasFeature(); // useless; always returns true
};

doctype = document . implementation . createDocumentType(name,
publicId, systemId)
Returns a doctype, with the given name, publicId, and systemId.

If name is not a valid doctype name, an "InvalidCharacterError"
DOMException is thrown.

doc = document . implementation . createDocument(namespace,
qualifiedName [, doctype = null])
Returns an XMLDocument, with a document element whose local name
is qualifiedName and whose namespace is namespace (unless
qualifiedName is the empty string), and with doctype, if it is
given, as its doctype.

This method throws the same exceptions as the createElementNS()
method, when invoked with namespace and qualifiedName.

doc = document . implementation . createHTMLDocument([title])
Returns a document, with a basic tree already constructed
including a title element, unless the title argument is omitted.

The createDocumentType(name, publicId, systemId) method steps are:
1. If name is not a valid doctype name, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
2. Return a new doctype, with name as its name, publicId as its public
ID, and systemId as its system ID, and with its node document set
to the associated document of this.

The createDocument(namespace, qualifiedName, doctype) method steps are:
1. Let document be a new XMLDocument.
2. Let element be null.
3. If qualifiedName is not the empty string, then set element to the
result of running the internal createElementNS steps, given
document, namespace, qualifiedName, and an empty dictionary.
4. If doctype is non-null, append doctype to document.
5. If element is non-null, append element to document.
6. document’s origin is this’s associated document’s origin.
7. document’s content type is determined by namespace:

HTML namespace
application/xhtml+xml

SVG namespace
image/svg+xml

Any other namespace
application/xml

8. Return document.

The createHTMLDocument(title) method steps are:
1. Let doc be a new document that is an HTML document.
2. Set doc’s content type to "text/html".
3. Append a new doctype, with "html" as its name and with its node
document set to doc, to doc.
4. Append the result of creating an element given doc, "html", and the
HTML namespace, to doc.
5. Append the result of creating an element given doc, "head", and the
HTML namespace, to the html element created earlier.
6. If title is given:
1. Append the result of creating an element given doc, "title",
and the HTML namespace, to the head element created earlier.
2. Append a new Text node, with its data set to title (which
could be the empty string) and its node document set to doc,
to the title element created earlier.
7. Append the result of creating an element given doc, "body", and the
HTML namespace, to the html element created earlier.
8. doc’s origin is this’s associated document’s origin.
9. Return doc.

The hasFeature() method steps are to return true.

hasFeature() originally would report whether the user agent claimed to
support a given DOM feature, but experience proved it was not nearly as
reliable or granular as simply checking whether the desired objects,
attributes, or methods existed. As such, it is no longer to be used,
but continues to exist (and simply returns true) so that old pages
don’t stop working.

4.6. Interface DocumentType

[Exposed=Window]
interface DocumentType : Node {
readonly attribute DOMString name;
readonly attribute DOMString publicId;
readonly attribute DOMString systemId;
};

DocumentType nodes are simply known as doctypes.

Doctypes have an associated name, public ID, and system ID.

When a doctype is created, its name is always given. Unless explicitly
given when a doctype is created, its public ID and system ID are the
empty string.

The name getter steps are to return this’s name.

The publicId getter steps are to return this’s public ID.

The systemId getter steps are to return this’s system ID.

4.7. Interface DocumentFragment

[Exposed=Window]
interface DocumentFragment : Node {
constructor();
};

A DocumentFragment node has an associated host (null or an element in a
different node tree). It is null unless otherwise stated.

An object A is a host-including inclusive ancestor of an object B, if
either A is an inclusive ancestor of B, or if B’s root has a non-null
host and A is a host-including inclusive ancestor of B’s root’s host.

The DocumentFragment node’s host concept is useful for HTML’s template
element and for shadow roots, and impacts the pre-insert and replace
algorithms.

tree = new DocumentFragment()
Returns a new DocumentFragment node.

The new DocumentFragment() constructor steps are to set this’s node
document to current global object’s associated Document.

4.8. Interface ShadowRoot

[Exposed=Window]
interface ShadowRoot : DocumentFragment {
readonly attribute ShadowRootMode mode;
readonly attribute boolean delegatesFocus;
readonly attribute SlotAssignmentMode slotAssignment;
readonly attribute boolean clonable;
readonly attribute boolean serializable;
readonly attribute Element host;

attribute EventHandler onslotchange;
};

enum ShadowRootMode { "open", "closed" };
enum SlotAssignmentMode { "manual", "named" };

ShadowRoot nodes are simply known as shadow roots.

Shadow roots’s associated host is never null.

Shadow roots have an associated mode ("open" or "closed").

Shadow roots have an associated delegates focus (a boolean). It is
initially set to false.

Shadow roots have an associated available to element internals (a
boolean). It is initially set to false.

Shadow roots have an associated declarative (a boolean). It is
initially set to false.

Shadow roots have an associated slot assignment ("manual" or "named").

Shadow roots have an associated clonable (a boolean). It is initially
set to false.

Shadow roots have an associated serializable (a boolean). It is
initially set to false.

Shadow roots have an associated custom element registry (null or a
CustomElementRegistry object). It is initially null.

Shadow roots have an associated keep custom element registry null (a
boolean). It is initially false.

This can only ever be true in combination with declarative shadow
roots. And it only matters for as long as the shadow root’s custom
element registry is null.
__________________________________________________________________

A shadow root’s get the parent algorithm, given an event, returns null
if event’s composed flag is unset and shadow root is the root of
event’s path’s first struct’s invocation target; otherwise shadow
root’s host.
__________________________________________________________________

The mode getter steps are to return this’s mode.

The delegatesFocus getter steps are to return this’s delegates focus.

The slotAssignment getter steps are to return this’s slot assignment.

The clonable getter steps are to return this’s clonable.

The serializable getter steps are to return this’s serializable.

The host getter steps are to return this’s host.
__________________________________________________________________

The onslotchange attribute is an event handler IDL attribute for the
onslotchange event handler, whose event handler event type is
slotchange.
__________________________________________________________________

In shadow-including tree order is shadow-including preorder,
depth-first traversal of a node tree. Shadow-including preorder,
depth-first traversal of a node tree tree is preorder, depth-first
traversal of tree, with for each shadow host encountered in tree,
shadow-including preorder, depth-first traversal of that element’s
shadow root’s node tree just after it is encountered.

The shadow-including root of an object is its root’s host’s
shadow-including root, if the object’s root is a shadow root; otherwise
its root.

An object A is a shadow-including descendant of an object B, if A is a
descendant of B, or A’s root is a shadow root and A’s root’s host is a
shadow-including inclusive descendant of B.

A shadow-including inclusive descendant is an object or one of its
shadow-including descendants.

An object A is a shadow-including ancestor of an object B, if and only
if B is a shadow-including descendant of A.

A shadow-including inclusive ancestor is an object or one of its
shadow-including ancestors.

A node A is closed-shadow-hidden from a node B if all of the following
conditions are true:
* A’s root is a shadow root.
* A’s root is not a shadow-including inclusive ancestor of B.
* A’s root is a shadow root whose mode is "closed" or A’s root’s host
is closed-shadow-hidden from B.

To retarget an object A against an object B, repeat these steps until
they return an object:
1. If one of the following is true
+ A is not a node
+ A’s root is not a shadow root
+ B is a node and A’s root is a shadow-including inclusive
ancestor of B
then return A.
2. Set A to A’s root’s host.

The retargeting algorithm is used by event dispatch as well as other
specifications, such as Fullscreen. [FULLSCREEN]

4.9. Interface Element

[Exposed=Window]
interface Element : Node {
readonly attribute DOMString? namespaceURI;
readonly attribute DOMString? prefix;
readonly attribute DOMString localName;
readonly attribute DOMString tagName;

[CEReactions] attribute DOMString id;
[CEReactions] attribute DOMString className;
[SameObject, PutForwards=value] readonly attribute DOMTokenList classList;
[CEReactions, Unscopable] attribute DOMString slot;

boolean hasAttributes();
[SameObject] readonly attribute NamedNodeMap attributes;
sequence<DOMString> getAttributeNames();
DOMString? getAttribute(DOMString qualifiedName);
DOMString? getAttributeNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString localName);
[CEReactions] undefined setAttribute(DOMString qualifiedName, (TrustedType or
DOMString) value);
[CEReactions] undefined setAttributeNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString qualifi
edName, (TrustedType or DOMString) value);
[CEReactions] undefined removeAttribute(DOMString qualifiedName);
[CEReactions] undefined removeAttributeNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString loca
lName);
[CEReactions] boolean toggleAttribute(DOMString qualifiedName, optional boolea
n force);
boolean hasAttribute(DOMString qualifiedName);
boolean hasAttributeNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString localName);

Attr? getAttributeNode(DOMString qualifiedName);
Attr? getAttributeNodeNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString localName);
[CEReactions] Attr? setAttributeNode(Attr attr);
[CEReactions] Attr? setAttributeNodeNS(Attr attr);
[CEReactions] Attr removeAttributeNode(Attr attr);

ShadowRoot attachShadow(ShadowRootInit init);
readonly attribute ShadowRoot? shadowRoot;

readonly attribute CustomElementRegistry? customElementRegistry;

Element? closest(DOMString selectors);
boolean matches(DOMString selectors);
boolean webkitMatchesSelector(DOMString selectors); // legacy alias of .matche
s

HTMLCollection getElementsByTagName(DOMString qualifiedName);
HTMLCollection getElementsByTagNameNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString localNam
e);
HTMLCollection getElementsByClassName(DOMString classNames);

[CEReactions] Element? insertAdjacentElement(DOMString where, Element element)
; // legacy
undefined insertAdjacentText(DOMString where, DOMString data); // legacy
};

dictionary ShadowRootInit {
required ShadowRootMode mode;
boolean delegatesFocus = false;
SlotAssignmentMode slotAssignment = "named";
boolean clonable = false;
boolean serializable = false;
CustomElementRegistry? customElementRegistry;
};

ShadowRootInit somewhat unusually allows both undefined and null to be
passed to its customElementRegistry member to allow web developers to
pass a ShadowRoot node instead of a dictionary to attachShadow().

Element nodes are simply known as elements.

Elements have an associated:

namespace
Null or a non-empty string.

namespace prefix
Null or a non-empty string.

local name
A non-empty string.

custom element registry
Null or a CustomElementRegistry object.

custom element state
"undefined", "failed", "uncustomized", "precustomized", or
"custom".

custom element definition
Null or a custom element definition.

is value
Null or a valid custom element name.

When an element is created, all of these values are initialized.

An element whose custom element state is "uncustomized" or "custom" is
said to be defined. An element whose custom element state is "custom"
is said to be custom.

Whether or not an element is defined is used to determine the behavior
of the :defined pseudo-class. Whether or not an element is custom is
used to determine the behavior of the mutation algorithms. The "failed"
and "precustomized" states are used to ensure that if a custom element
constructor fails to execute correctly the first time, it is not
executed again by an upgrade.

The following code illustrates elements in each of these four states:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script>
window.customElements.define("sw-rey", class extends HTMLElement {})
window.customElements.define("sw-finn", class extends HTMLElement {}, { extend
s: "p" })
window.customElements.define("sw-kylo", class extends HTMLElement {
constructor() {
// super() intentionally omitted for this example
}
})
</script>

<!-- "undefined" (not defined, not custom) -->
<sw-han></sw-han>
<p is="sw-luke"></p>
<p is="asdf"></p>

<!-- "failed" (not defined, not custom) -->
<sw-kylo></sw-kylo>

<!-- "uncustomized" (defined, not custom) -->
<p></p>
<asdf></asdf>

<!-- "custom" (defined, custom) -->
<sw-rey></sw-rey>
<p is="sw-finn"></p>

Elements also have an associated shadow root (null or a shadow root).
It is null unless otherwise stated. An element is a shadow host if its
shadow root is non-null.

An element’s qualified name is its local name if its namespace prefix
is null; otherwise its namespace prefix, followed by ":", followed by
its local name.

An element’s HTML-uppercased qualified name is the return value of
these steps:
1. Let qualifiedName be this’s qualified name.
2. If this is in the HTML namespace and its node document is an HTML
document, then set qualifiedName to qualifiedName in ASCII
uppercase.
3. Return qualifiedName.

User agents could optimize qualified name and HTML-uppercased qualified
name by storing them in internal slots.

To create an element, given a document document, string localName,
string-or-null namespace, and optionally a string-or-null prefix
(default null), string-or-null is (default null), boolean
synchronousCustomElements (default false), and "default", null, or a
CustomElementRegistry object registry (default "default"):
1. Let result be null.
2. If registry is "default", then set registry to the result of
looking up a custom element registry given document.
3. Let definition be the result of looking up a custom element
definition given registry, namespace, localName, and is.
4. If definition is non-null, and definition’s name is not equal to
its local name (i.e., definition represents a customized built-in
element):
1. Let interface be the element interface for localName and the
HTML namespace.
2. Set result to the result of creating an element internal given
document, interface, localName, the HTML namespace, prefix,
"undefined", is, and registry.
3. If synchronousCustomElements is true, then run this step while
catching any exceptions:
1. Upgrade result using definition.
If this step threw an exception exception:
1. Report exception for definition’s constructor’s
corresponding JavaScript object’s associated realm’s
global object.
2. Set result’s custom element state to "failed".
4. Otherwise, enqueue a custom element upgrade reaction given
result and definition.
5. Otherwise, if definition is non-null:
1. If synchronousCustomElements is true:
1. Let C be definition’s constructor.
2. Set the surrounding agent’s active custom element
constructor map[C] to registry.
3. Run these steps while catching any exceptions:
1. Set result to the result of constructing C, with no
arguments.
2. Assert: result’s custom element state and custom
element definition are initialized.
3. Assert: result’s namespace is the HTML namespace.
IDL enforces that result is an HTMLElement object,
which all use the HTML namespace.
4. If result’s attribute list is not empty, then throw
a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.
5. If result has children, then throw a
"NotSupportedError" DOMException.
6. If result’s parent is non-null, then throw a
"NotSupportedError" DOMException.
7. If result’s node document is not document, then
throw a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.
8. If result’s local name is not equal to localName,
then throw a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.
9. Set result’s namespace prefix to prefix.
10. Set result’s is value to null.
11. Set result’s custom element registry to registry.
If any of these steps threw an exception exception:
1. Report exception for definition’s constructor’s
corresponding JavaScript object’s associated realm’s
global object.
2. Set result to the result of creating an element
internal given document, HTMLUnknownElement,
localName, the HTML namespace, prefix, "failed",
null, and registry.
4. Remove the surrounding agent’s active custom element
constructor map[C].
Under normal circumstances it will already have been
removed at this point.
2. Otherwise:
1. Set result to the result of creating an element internal
given document, HTMLElement, localName, the HTML
namespace, prefix, "undefined", null, and registry.
2. Enqueue a custom element upgrade reaction given result
and definition.
6. Otherwise:
1. Let interface be the element interface for localName and
namespace.
2. Set result to the result of creating an element internal given
document, interface, localName, namespace, prefix,
"uncustomized", is, and registry.
3. If namespace is the HTML namespace, and either localName is a
valid custom element name or is is non-null, then set result’s
custom element state to "undefined".
7. Return result.

To create an element internal given a document document, an interface
interface a string localName, a string-or-null namespace, a
string-or-null prefix, a string state, a string-or-null is, and null or
a CustomElementRegistry object registry:
1. Let element be a new element that implements interface, with
namespace set to namespace, namespace prefix set to prefix, local
name set to localName, custom element registry set to registry,
custom element state set to state, custom element definition set to
null, is value set to is, and node document set to document.
2. Assert: element’s attribute list is empty.
3. Return element.

Elements also have an attribute list, which is a list exposed through a
NamedNodeMap. Unless explicitly given when an element is created, its
attribute list is empty.

An element has an attribute A if its attribute list contains A.

This and other specifications may define attribute change steps for
elements. The algorithm is passed element, localName, oldValue, value,
and namespace.

To handle attribute changes for an attribute attribute with element,
oldValue, and newValue, run these steps:
1. Queue a mutation record of "attributes" for element with
attribute’s local name, attribute’s namespace, oldValue, « », « »,
null, and null.
2. If element is custom, then enqueue a custom element callback
reaction with element, callback name "attributeChangedCallback",
and « attribute’s local name, oldValue, newValue, attribute’s
namespace ».
3. Run the attribute change steps with element, attribute’s local
name, oldValue, newValue, and attribute’s namespace.

To change an attribute attribute to value, run these steps:
1. Let oldValue be attribute’s value.
2. Set attribute’s value to value.
3. Handle attribute changes for attribute with attribute’s element,
oldValue, and value.

To append an attribute attribute to an element element, run these
steps:
1. Append attribute to element’s attribute list.
2. Set attribute’s element to element.
3. Set attribute’s node document to element’s node document.
4. Handle attribute changes for attribute with element, null, and
attribute’s value.

To remove an attribute attribute, run these steps:
1. Let element be attribute’s element.
2. Remove attribute from element’s attribute list.
3. Set attribute’s element to null.
4. Handle attribute changes for attribute with element, attribute’s
value, and null.

To replace an attribute oldAttribute with an attribute newAttribute:
1. Let element be oldAttribute’s element.
2. Replace oldAttribute by newAttribute in element’s attribute list.
3. Set newAttribute’s element to element.
4. Set newAttribute’s node document to element’s node document.
5. Set oldAttribute’s element to null.
6. Handle attribute changes for oldAttribute with element,
oldAttribute’s value, and newAttribute’s value.
__________________________________________________________________

To get an attribute by name given a string qualifiedName and an element
element:
1. If element is in the HTML namespace and its node document is an
HTML document, then set qualifiedName to qualifiedName in ASCII
lowercase.
2. Return the first attribute in element’s attribute list whose
qualified name is qualifiedName; otherwise null.

To get an attribute by namespace and local name given null or a string
namespace, a string localName, and an element element:
1. If namespace is the empty string, then set it to null.
2. Return the attribute in element’s attribute list whose namespace is
namespace and local name is localName, if any; otherwise null.

To get an attribute value given an element element, a string localName,
and an optional null or string namespace (default null):
1. Let attr be the result of getting an attribute given namespace,
localName, and element.
2. If attr is null, then return the empty string.
3. Return attr’s value.

To set an attribute given an attribute attr and an element element:
1. Let verifiedValue be the result of calling get trusted type
compliant attribute value with attr’s local name, attr’s namespace,
element, and attr’s value. [TRUSTED-TYPES]
2. If attr’s element is neither null nor element, throw an
"InUseAttributeError" DOMException.
3. Let oldAttr be the result of getting an attribute given attr’s
namespace, attr’s local name, and element.
4. If oldAttr is attr, return attr.
5. Set attr’s value to verifiedValue.
6. If oldAttr is non-null, then replace oldAttr with attr.
7. Otherwise, append attr to element.
8. Return oldAttr.

To set an attribute value given an element element, a string localName,
a string value, an optional null or string prefix (default null), and
an optional null or string namespace (default null):
1. Let attribute be the result of getting an attribute given
namespace, localName, and element.
2. If attribute is null, create an attribute whose namespace is
namespace, namespace prefix is prefix, local name is localName,
value is value, and node document is element’s node document, then
append this attribute to element, and then return.
3. Change attribute to value.

To remove an attribute by name given a string qualifiedName and an
element element:
1. Let attr be the result of getting an attribute given qualifiedName
and element.
2. If attr is non-null, then remove attr.
3. Return attr.

To remove an attribute by namespace and local name given null or a
string namespace, a string localName, and an element element:
1. Let attr be the result of getting an attribute given namespace,
localName, and element.
2. If attr is non-null, then remove attr.
3. Return attr.
__________________________________________________________________

An element can have an associated unique identifier (ID)

Historically elements could have multiple identifiers e.g., by using
the HTML id attribute and a DTD. This specification makes ID a concept
of the DOM and allows for only one per element, given by an id
attribute.

Use these attribute change steps to update an element’s ID:
1. If localName is id, namespace is null, and value is null or the
empty string, then unset element’s ID.
2. Otherwise, if localName is id, namespace is null, then set
element’s ID to value.

While this specification defines requirements for class, id, and slot
attributes on any element, it makes no claims as to whether using them
is conforming or not.
__________________________________________________________________

A node’s parent of type Element is known as its parent element. If the
node has a parent of a different type, its parent element is null.
__________________________________________________________________

namespace = element . namespaceURI
Returns the namespace.

prefix = element . prefix
Returns the namespace prefix.

localName = element . localName
Returns the local name.

qualifiedName = element . tagName
Returns the HTML-uppercased qualified name.

The namespaceURI getter steps are to return this’s namespace.

The prefix getter steps are to return this’s namespace prefix.

The localName getter steps are to return this’s local name.

The tagName getter steps are to return this’s HTML-uppercased qualified
name.
__________________________________________________________________

element . id [ = value ]
Returns the value of element’s id content attribute. Can be set
to change it.

element . className [ = value ]
Returns the value of element’s class content attribute. Can be
set to change it.

element . classList
Allows for manipulation of element’s class content attribute as
a set of whitespace-separated tokens through a DOMTokenList
object.

element . slot [ = value ]
Returns the value of element’s slot content attribute. Can be
set to change it.

IDL attributes that are defined to reflect a string name, must have
these getter and setter steps:

getter steps
Return the result of running get an attribute value given this
and name.

setter steps
Set an attribute value for this using name and the given value.

The id attribute must reflect "id".

The className attribute must reflect "class".

The classList getter steps are to return a DOMTokenList object whose
associated element is this and whose associated attribute’s local name
is class. The token set of this particular DOMTokenList object are also
known as the element’s classes.

The slot attribute must reflect "slot".

id, class, and slot are effectively superglobal attributes as they can
appear on any element, regardless of that element’s namespace.

4.9.1. Interface NamedNodeMap

[Exposed=Window,
LegacyUnenumerableNamedProperties]
interface NamedNodeMap {
readonly attribute unsigned long length;
getter Attr? item(unsigned long index);
getter Attr? getNamedItem(DOMString qualifiedName);

[CEReactions] Attr? setNamedItemNS(Attr attr);
[CEReactions] Attr removeNamedItem(DOMString qualifiedName);
[CEReactions] Attr removeNamedItemNS(DOMString? namespace, DOMString localName
);
};

A NamedNodeMap has an associated element (an element).

A NamedNodeMap object’s attribute list is its element’s attribute list.
__________________________________________________________________

A NamedNodeMap object’s supported property indices are the numbers in
the range zero to its attribute list’s size − 1, unless the attribute
list is empty, in which case there are no supported property indices.

The length getter steps are to return the attribute list’s size.

The item(index) method steps are:
1. If index is equal to or greater than this’s attribute list’s size,
then return null.
2. Otherwise, return this’s attribute list[index].

A NamedNodeMap object’s supported property names are the return value
of running these steps:
1. Let names be the qualified names of the attributes in this
NamedNodeMap object’s attribute list, with duplicates omitted, in
order.
2. If this NamedNodeMap object’s element is in the HTML namespace and
its node document is an HTML document, then for each name of names:

4.9.2. Interface Attr

[Exposed=Window]
interface Attr : Node {
readonly attribute DOMString? namespaceURI;
readonly attribute DOMString? prefix;
readonly attribute DOMString localName;
readonly attribute DOMString name;
[CEReactions] attribute DOMString value;

readonly attribute Element? ownerElement;

readonly attribute boolean specified; // useless; always returns true
};

Attr nodes are simply known as attributes. They are sometimes referred
to as content attributes to avoid confusion with IDL attributes.

Attributes have a namespace (null or a non-empty string), namespace
prefix (null or a non-empty string), local name (a non-empty string),
value (a string), and element (null or an element).

If designed today they would just have a name and value. ☹

An attribute’s qualified name is its local name if its namespace prefix
is null, and its namespace prefix, followed by ":", followed by its
local name, otherwise.

User agents could have this as an internal slot as an optimization.

When an attribute is created, its local name is given. Unless
explicitly given when an attribute is created, its namespace, namespace
prefix, and element are set to null, and its value is set to the empty
string.

An A attribute is an attribute whose local name is A and whose
namespace and namespace prefix are null.
__________________________________________________________________

The namespaceURI getter steps are to return this’s namespace.

The prefix getter steps are to return this’s namespace prefix.

The localName getter steps are to return this’s local name.

The name getter steps are to return this’s qualified name.

The value getter steps are to return this’s value.

To set an existing attribute value, given an attribute attribute and
string value, run these steps:
1. If attribute’s element is null, then set attribute’s value to value
and return.
2. Let element be attribute’s element.
3. Let verifiedValue be the result of calling get trusted type
compliant attribute value with attribute’s local name, attribute’s
namespace, element, and value. [TRUSTED-TYPES]
4. If attribute’s element is null, then set attribute’s value to
verifiedValue and return.
5. Change attribute to verifiedValue.

The value setter steps are to set an existing attribute value with this
and the given value.
__________________________________________________________________

The ownerElement getter steps are to return this’s element.

undefined appendData(DOMString data);
undefined insertData(unsigned long offset, DOMString data);
undefined deleteData(unsigned long offset, unsigned long count);

a);
};

CharacterData is an abstract interface. You cannot get a direct
instance of it. It is used by Text, ProcessingInstruction, and Comment
nodes.

Each node inheriting from the CharacterData interface has an associated
mutable string called data.

To replace data of a node node with an integer offset, integer count,
and string data:
1. Let length be node’s length.
2. If offset is greater than length, then throw an "IndexSizeError"
DOMException.
3. If offset + count is greater than length, then set count to length
− offset.
4. Queue a mutation record of "characterData" for node with null,
null, node’s data, « », « », null, and null.
5. Insert data into node’s data after offset code units.
6. Let deleteOffset be offset + data’s length.
7. Starting from deleteOffset code units, remove count code units from
node’s data.
8. For each live range whose start node is node and start offset is
greater than offset but less than or equal to offset + count: set
its start offset to offset.
9. For each live range whose end node is node and end offset is
greater than offset but less than or equal to offset + count: set
its end offset to offset.
10. For each live range whose start node is node and start offset is
greater than offset + count: increase its start offset by data’s
length and decrease it by count.
11. For each live range whose end node is node and end offset is
greater than offset + count: increase its end offset by data’s
length and decrease it by count.
12. If node’s parent is non-null, then run the children changed steps
for node’s parent.

To substring data of a node node with an integer offset and integer
count:
1. Let length be node’s length.
2. If offset is greater than length, then throw an "IndexSizeError"
DOMException.
3. If offset + count is greater than length, then return a string
whose value is the code units from the offset^th code unit to the
end of node’s data.
4. Return a string whose value is the code units from the offset^th
code unit to the offset+count^th code unit in node’s data.

The data getter steps are to return this’s data. Its setter steps are
to replace data of this with 0, this’s length, and the given value.

The length getter steps are to return this’s length.

text . splitText(offset)
Splits data at the given offset and returns the remainder as
Text node.

text . wholeText
Returns the combined data of all direct Text node siblings.
__________________________________________________________________

An exclusive Text node is a Text node that is not a CDATASection node.

The contiguous Text nodes of a node node are node, node’s previous
sibling Text node, if any, and its contiguous Text nodes, and node’s
next sibling Text node, if any, and its contiguous Text nodes, avoiding
any duplicates.

The contiguous exclusive Text nodes of a node node are node, node’s
previous sibling exclusive Text node, if any, and its contiguous
exclusive Text nodes, and node’s next sibling exclusive Text node, if
any, and its contiguous exclusive Text nodes, avoiding any duplicates.

The child text content of a node node is the concatenation of the data
of all the Text node children of node, in tree order.

The descendant text content of a node node is the concatenation of the
data of all the Text node descendants of node, in tree order.
__________________________________________________________________

7. If parent is non-null:
1. Insert newNode into parent before node’s next sibling.
2. For each live range whose start node is node and start offset
is greater than offset, set its start node to newNode and
decrease its start offset by offset.
3. For each live range whose end node is node and end offset is
greater than offset, set its end node to newNode and decrease
its end offset by offset.
4. For each live range whose start node is parent and start
offset is equal to the index of node plus 1, increase its
start offset by 1.
5. For each live range whose end node is parent and end offset is
equal to the index of node plus 1, increase its end offset by
1.
8. Replace data of node with offset, count, and the empty string.
9. Return newNode.

The splitText(offset) method steps are to split this with offset
offset.

The wholeText getter steps are to return the concatenation of the data
of the contiguous Text nodes of this, in tree order.

and this’s node document to current global object’s associated
Document.

5. Ranges

5.1. Introduction to "DOM Ranges"

StaticRange and Range objects (ranges) represent a sequence of content
within a node tree. Each range has a start and an end which are
boundary points. A boundary point is a tuple consisting of a node and
an offset. So in other words, a range represents a piece of content
within a node tree between two boundary points.

Ranges are frequently used in editing for selecting and copying
content.
* Element: p
+ Element: <img src="insanity-wolf" alt="Little-endian BOM;
decode as big-endian!">
+ Text: CSS 2.1 syndata is
+ Element: <em>
o Text: awesome
+ Text: !

In the node tree above, a range can be used to represent the sequence
“syndata is awes”. Assuming p is assigned to the p element, and em to
the em element, this would be done as follows:
var range = new Range(),
firstText = p.childNodes[1],
secondText = em.firstChild
range.setStart(firstText, 9) // do not forget the leading space
range.setEnd(secondText, 4)
// range now stringifies to the aforementioned quote

Attributes such as src and alt in the node tree above cannot be
represented by a range. Ranges are only useful for nodes.

Range objects, unlike StaticRange objects, are affected by mutations to
the node tree. Therefore they are also known as live ranges. Such
mutations will not invalidate them and will try to ensure that it still
represents the same piece of content. Necessarily, a live range might
itself be modified as part of the mutation to the node tree when, e.g.,
part of the content it represents is mutated.

See the insert and remove algorithms, the normalize() method, and the
replace data and split algorithms for details.

Updating live ranges in response to node tree mutations can be
expensive. For every node tree change, all affected Range objects need
to be updated. Even if the application is uninterested in some live
ranges, it still has to pay the cost of keeping them up-to-date when a
mutation occurs.

A StaticRange object is a lightweight range that does not update when
the node tree mutates. It is therefore not subject to the same
maintenance cost as live ranges.

5.2. Boundary points

A boundary point is a tuple consisting of a node (a node) and an offset
(a non-negative integer).

A correct boundary point’s offset will be between 0 and the boundary
point’s node’s length, inclusive.

The position of a boundary point (nodeA, offsetA) relative to a
boundary point (nodeB, offsetB) is before, equal, or after, as returned
by these steps:
1. Assert: nodeA and nodeB have the same root.
2. If nodeA is nodeB, then return equal if offsetA is offsetB, before
if offsetA is less than offsetB, and after if offsetA is greater
than offsetB.
3. If nodeA is following nodeB, then if the position of (nodeB,
offsetB) relative to (nodeA, offsetA) is before, return after, and
if it is after, return before.
4. If nodeA is an ancestor of nodeB:
1. Let child be nodeB.
2. While child is not a child of nodeA, set child to its parent.
3. If child’s index is less than offsetA, then return after.
5. Return before.

5.3. Interface AbstractRange

[Exposed=Window]
interface AbstractRange {
readonly attribute Node startContainer;
readonly attribute unsigned long startOffset;
readonly attribute Node endContainer;
readonly attribute unsigned long endOffset;
readonly attribute boolean collapsed;
};

Objects implementing the AbstractRange interface are known as ranges.

A range has two associated boundary points — a start and end.

For convenience, a range’s start node is its start’s node, its start
offset is its start’s offset, its end node is its end’s node, and its
end offset is its end’s offset.

A range is collapsed if its start node is its end node and its start
offset is its end offset.

node = range . startContainer
Returns range’s start node.

offset = range . startOffset
Returns range’s start offset.

node = range . endContainer
Returns range’s end node.

offset = range . endOffset
Returns range’s end offset.

collapsed = range . collapsed
Returns true if range is collapsed; otherwise false.

The startContainer getter steps are to return this’s start node.

The startOffset getter steps are to return this’s start offset.

The endContainer getter steps are to return this’s end node.

The endOffset getter steps are to return this’s end offset.

The collapsed getter steps are to return true if this is collapsed;
otherwise false.

5.4. Interface StaticRange

dictionary StaticRangeInit {
required Node startContainer;
required unsigned long startOffset;
required Node endContainer;
required unsigned long endOffset;
};

[Exposed=Window]
interface StaticRange : AbstractRange {
constructor(StaticRangeInit init);
};

staticRange = new StaticRange(init)
Returns a new range object that does not update when the node
tree mutates.

The new StaticRange(init) constructor steps are:
1. If init["startContainer"] or init["endContainer"] is a DocumentType
or Attr node, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError" DOMException.
2. Set this’s start to (init["startContainer"], init["startOffset"])
and end to (init["endContainer"], init["endOffset"]).

A StaticRange is valid if all of the following are true:
* Its start and end are in the same node tree.
* Its start offset is between 0 and its start node’s length,
inclusive.
* Its end offset is between 0 and its end node’s length, inclusive.
* Its start is before or equal to its end.

5.5. Interface Range

Objects implementing the Range interface are known as live ranges.

Algorithms that modify a tree (in particular the insert, remove, move,
replace data, and split algorithms) modify live ranges associated with
that tree.

The root of a live range is the root of its start node.

A node node is contained in a live range range if node’s root is
range’s root, and (node, 0) is after range’s start, and (node, node’s
length) is before range’s end.

A node is partially contained in a live range if it’s an inclusive
ancestor of the live range’s start node but not its end node, or vice
versa.

Some facts to better understand these definitions:
* The content that one would think of as being within the live range
consists of all contained nodes, plus possibly some of the contents
of the start node and end node if those are CharacterData nodes.
* The nodes that are contained in a live range will generally not be
contiguous, because the parent of a contained node will not always
be contained.
* However, the descendants of a contained node are contained, and if
two siblings are contained, so are any siblings that lie between
them.
* The start node and end node of a live range are never contained
within it.
* The first contained node (if there are any) will always be after
the start node, and the last contained node will always be equal to
or before the end node’s last descendant.
* There exists a partially contained node if and only if the start
node and end node are different.
* The commonAncestorContainer attribute value is neither contained
nor partially contained.
* If the start node is an ancestor of the end node, the common
inclusive ancestor will be the start node. Exactly one of its
children will be partially contained, and a child will be contained
if and only if it precedes the partially contained child. If the
end node is an ancestor of the start node, the opposite holds.
* If the start node is not an inclusive ancestor of the end node, nor
vice versa, the common inclusive ancestor will be distinct from
both of them. Exactly two of its children will be partially
contained, and a child will be contained if and only if it lies
between those two.

The live range pre-remove steps given a node node, are:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. Assert: parent is non-null.
3. Let index be node’s index.
4. For each live range whose start node is an inclusive descendant of
node, set its start to (parent, index).
5. For each live range whose end node is an inclusive descendant of
node, set its end to (parent, index).
6. For each live range whose start node is parent and start offset is
greater than index, decrease its start offset by 1.
7. For each live range whose end node is parent and end offset is
greater than index, decrease its end offset by 1.
__________________________________________________________________

range = new Range()
Returns a new live range.

The new Range() constructor steps are to set this’s start and end to
(current global object’s associated Document, 0).
__________________________________________________________________

container = range . commonAncestorContainer
Returns the node, furthest away from the document, that is an
ancestor of both range’s start node and end node.

The commonAncestorContainer getter steps are:
1. Let container be start node.
2. While container is not an inclusive ancestor of end node: set
container to container’s parent.
3. Return container.
__________________________________________________________________

To set the start or end of a range to a boundary point (node, offset):
1. If node is a doctype, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
2. If offset is greater than node’s length, then throw an
"IndexSizeError" DOMException.
3. Let boundaryPoint be the boundary point (node, offset).
4.

If these steps were invoked as "set the start"

1. If range’s root is not node’s root or boundaryPoint is
after range’s end, then set range’s end to boundaryPoint.
2. Set range’s start to boundaryPoint.

If these steps were invoked as "set the end"

1. If range’s root is not node’s root or boundaryPoint is
before range’s start, then set range’s start to
boundaryPoint.
2. Set range’s end to boundaryPoint.

The setStart(node, offset) method steps are to set the start of this to
boundary point (node, offset).

The setEnd(node, offset) method steps are to set the end of this to
boundary point (node, offset).

The setStartBefore(node) method steps are:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. If parent is null, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
3. Set the start of this to boundary point (parent, node’s index).

The setStartAfter(node) method steps are:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. If parent is null, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
3. Set the start of this to boundary point (parent, node’s index plus
1).

The setEndBefore(node) method steps are:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. If parent is null, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
3. Set the end of this to boundary point (parent, node’s index).

The setEndAfter(node) method steps are:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. If parent is null, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
3. Set the end of this to boundary point (parent, node’s index plus
1).

The collapse(toStart) method steps are to, if toStart is true, set end
to start; otherwise set start to end.

To select a node node within a range range:
1. Let parent be node’s parent.
2. If parent is null, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
3. Let index be node’s index.
4. Set range’s start to boundary point (parent, index).
5. Set range’s end to boundary point (parent, index plus 1).

The selectNode(node) method steps are to select node within this.

The selectNodeContents(node) method steps are:
1. If node is a doctype, then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError"
DOMException.
2. Let length be the length of node.
3. Set start to the boundary point (node, 0).
4. Set end to the boundary point (node, length).
__________________________________________________________________

The compareBoundaryPoints(how, sourceRange) method steps are:
1. If how is not one of
+ START_TO_START,
+ START_TO_END,
+ END_TO_END, and
+ END_TO_START,
then throw a "NotSupportedError" DOMException.
2. If this’s root is not sourceRange’s root, then throw a
"WrongDocumentError" DOMException.
3. Let thisPoint and sourcePoint be null.
4. Switch on how:

START_TO_START:
Set thisPoint to this’s start and sourcePoint to
sourceRange’s start.

START_TO_END:
Set thisPoint to this’s end and sourcePoint to
sourceRange’s start.

END_TO_END:
Set thisPoint to this’s end and sourcePoint to
sourceRange’s end.

END_TO_START:
Set thisPoint to this’s start and sourcePoint to
sourceRange’s end.

5. Switch on the position of thisPoint relative to sourcePoint:

before
Return −1.

equal
Return 0.

after
Return 1.

The deleteContents() method steps are:
1. If this is collapsed, then return.
2. Let originalStartNode, originalStartOffset, originalEndNode, and
originalEndOffset be this’s start node, start offset, end node, and
end offset, respectively.
3. If originalStartNode is originalEndNode and it is a CharacterData
node:
1. Replace data of originalStartNode with originalStartOffset,
originalEndOffset − originalStartOffset, and the empty string.
2. Return.
4. Let nodesToRemove be a list of all the nodes that are contained in
this, in tree order, omitting any node whose parent is also
contained in this.
5. Let newNode and newOffset be null.
6. If originalStartNode is an inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode,
then set newNode to originalStartNode and newOffset to
originalStartOffset.
7. Otherwise:
1. Let referenceNode be originalStartNode.
2. While referenceNode’s parent is non-null and is not an
inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode: set referenceNode to
its parent.
3. Set newNode to referenceNode’s parent and newOffset to
referenceNode’s index + 1.
If referenceNode’s parent were null, it would be the root of
this. And then it would be an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode and we could not reach this point.
8. Set this’s start and end to (newNode, newOffset).
9. If originalStartNode is a CharacterData node, then replace data of
originalStartNode with originalStartOffset, originalStartNode’s
length − originalStartOffset, and the empty string.
10. For each node of nodesToRemove, in tree order: remove node.
11. If originalEndNode is a CharacterData node, then replace data of
originalEndNode with 0, originalEndOffset, and the empty string.

To extract a live range range:
1. Let fragment be a new DocumentFragment node whose node document is
range’s start node’s node document.
2. If range is collapsed, then return fragment.
3. Let originalStartNode, originalStartOffset, originalEndNode, and
originalEndOffset be range’s start node, start offset, end node,
and end offset, respectively.
4. If originalStartNode is originalEndNode and it is a CharacterData
node:
1. Let clone be a clone of originalStartNode.
2. Set clone’s data to the result of substringing data of
originalStartNode with originalStartOffset and
originalEndOffset − originalStartOffset.
3. Append clone to fragment.
4. Replace data of originalStartNode with originalStartOffset,
originalEndOffset − originalStartOffset, and the empty string.
5. Return fragment.
5. Let commonAncestor be originalStartNode.
6. While commonAncestor is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode: set commonAncestor to its own parent.
7. Let firstPartiallyContainedChild be null.
8. If originalStartNode is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode, then set firstPartiallyContainedChild to the first
child of commonAncestor that is partially contained in range.
9. Let lastPartiallyContainedChild be null.
10. If originalEndNode is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalStartNode, then set lastPartiallyContainedChild to the last
child of commonAncestor that is partially contained in range.
These variable assignments do actually always make sense. For
instance, if originalStartNode is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode, originalStartNode is itself partially contained in
range, and so are all its ancestors up until a child of
commonAncestor. commonAncestor cannot be originalStartNode, because
it has to be an inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode. The other
case is similar. Also, notice that the two children will never be
equal if both are defined.
11. Let containedChildren be a list of all children of commonAncestor
that are contained in range, in tree order.
12. If any member of containedChildren is a doctype, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
We do not have to worry about the first or last partially contained
node, because a doctype can never be partially contained. It cannot
be a boundary point of a range, and it cannot be the ancestor of
anything.
13. Let newNode and newOffset be null.
14. If originalStartNode is an inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode,
then set newNode to originalStartNode and newOffset to
originalStartOffset.

inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode: set referenceNode to
its parent.
3. Set newNode to the parent of referenceNode, and newOffset to
referenceNode’s index + 1.
If referenceNode’s parent is null, it would be the root of
range. And then it would be an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode and we could not reach this point.
16. Set range’s start and end to (newNode, newOffset).
17. If firstPartiallyContainedChild is a CharacterData node:
In this case, firstPartiallyContainedChild is originalStartNode.

originalStartNode with originalStartOffset and
originalStartNode’s length − originalStartOffset.
3. Append clone to fragment.
4. Replace data of originalStartNode with originalStartOffset,
originalStartNode’s length − originalStartOffset, and the
empty string.
18. Otherwise, if firstPartiallyContainedChild is non-null:
1. Let clone be a clone of firstPartiallyContainedChild.
2. Append clone to fragment.
3. Let subrange be a new live range whose start is
(originalStartNode, originalStartOffset) and whose end is
(firstPartiallyContainedChild, firstPartiallyContainedChild’s
length).
4. Let subfragment be the result of extracting subrange.
5. Append subfragment to clone.
19. For each contained child of containedChildren: append contained
child to fragment.
20. If lastPartiallyContainedChild is a CharacterData node:
In this case, lastPartiallyContainedChild is originalEndNode.
1. Let clone be a clone of originalEndNode.
2. Set clone’s data to the result of substringing data of
originalEndNode with 0 and originalEndOffset.
3. Append clone to fragment.
4. Replace data of originalEndNode with 0, originalEndOffset, and
the empty string.
21. Otherwise, if lastPartiallyContainedChild is non-null:
1. Let clone be a clone of lastPartiallyContainedChild.
2. Append clone to fragment.
3. Let subrange be a new live range whose start is
(lastPartiallyContainedChild, 0) and whose end is
(originalEndNode, originalEndOffset).
4. Let subfragment be the result of extracting subrange.
5. Append subfragment to clone.
22. Return fragment.

The extractContents() method steps are to return the result of
extracting this.

To clone the contents of a live range range:
1. Let fragment be a new DocumentFragment node whose node document is
range’s start node’s node document.
2. If range is collapsed, then return fragment.
3. Let originalStartNode, originalStartOffset, originalEndNode, and
originalEndOffset be range’s start node, start offset, end node,
and end offset, respectively.
4. If originalStartNode is originalEndNode and it is a CharacterData
node:
1. Let clone be a clone of originalStartNode.
2. Set clone’s data to the result of substringing data of
originalStartNode with originalStartOffset and
originalEndOffset − originalStartOffset.
3. Append clone to fragment.
4. Return fragment.
5. Let commonAncestor be originalStartNode.
6. While commonAncestor is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode: set commonAncestor to its own parent.
7. Let firstPartiallyContainedChild be null.
8. If originalStartNode is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalEndNode, then set firstPartiallyContainedChild to the first
child of commonAncestor that is partially contained in range.
9. Let lastPartiallyContainedChild be null.
10. If originalEndNode is not an inclusive ancestor of
originalStartNode, then set lastPartiallyContainedChild to the last
child of commonAncestor that is partially contained in range.
These variable assignments do actually always make sense. For

originalEndNode, originalStartNode is itself partially contained in
range, and so are all its ancestors up until a child of
commonAncestor. commonAncestor cannot be originalStartNode, because
it has to be an inclusive ancestor of originalEndNode. The other
case is similar. Also, notice that the two children will never be
equal if both are defined.
11. Let containedChildren be a list of all children of commonAncestor
that are contained in range, in tree order.
12. If any member of containedChildren is a doctype, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
We do not have to worry about the first or last partially contained
node, because a doctype can never be partially contained. It cannot
be a boundary point of a range, and it cannot be the ancestor of
anything.
13. If firstPartiallyContainedChild is a CharacterData node:
In this case, firstPartiallyContainedChild is originalStartNode.

(lastPartiallyContainedChild, 0) and whose end is
(originalEndNode, originalEndOffset).
4. Let subfragment be the result of cloning the contents of
subrange.
5. Append subfragment to clone.
18. Return fragment.

The cloneContents() method steps are to return the result of cloning
the contents of this.

To insert a node node into a live range range:
1. If range’s start node is a ProcessingInstruction or Comment node,
is a Text node whose parent is null, or is node, then throw a
"HierarchyRequestError" DOMException.
2. Let referenceNode be null.
3. If range’s start node is a Text node, then set referenceNode to
that Text node.
4. Otherwise, set referenceNode to the child of range’s start node
whose index is range’s start offset if there is such a child;
otherwise null.
5. Let parent be range’s start node if referenceNode is null;
otherwise referenceNode’s parent.
6. Ensure pre-insert validity of node into parent before
referenceNode.
7. If range’s start node is a Text node, then set referenceNode to the

8. If node is referenceNode, then set referenceNode to its next
sibling.
9. If node’s parent is non-null, then remove node.
10. Let newOffset be parent’s length if referenceNode is null;

The insertNode(node) method steps are to insert node into this.

The surroundContents(newParent) method steps are:
1. If a non-Text node is partially contained in this, then throw an
"InvalidStateError" DOMException.
2. If newParent is a Document, DocumentType, or DocumentFragment node,
then throw an "InvalidNodeTypeError" DOMException.
For historical reasons CharacterData nodes are not checked here and
end up throwing later on as a side effect.
3. Let fragment be the result of extracting this.
4. If newParent has children, then replace all with null within
newParent.
5. Insert newParent into this.
6. Append fragment to newParent.
7. Select newParent within this.

The cloneRange() method steps are to return a new live range with the
same start and end as this.

The detach() method steps are to do nothing. Its functionality
(disabling a Range object) was removed, but the method itself is
preserved for compatibility.

6. Traversal

NodeIterator and TreeWalker objects can be used to filter and traverse
node trees.

Each NodeIterator and TreeWalker object has an associated boolean is
active to avoid recursive invocations. It is initially false.

Each NodeIterator and TreeWalker object also has an associated root (a
node), a whatToShow (a bitmask), and a filter (a callback).

To filter a node node within a NodeIterator or TreeWalker object
traverser:
1. If traverser’s is active is true, then throw an "InvalidStateError"
DOMException.
2. Let n be node’s nodeType attribute value − 1.
3. If the n^th bit (where 0 is the least significant bit) of
traverser’s whatToShow is not set, then return FILTER_SKIP.
4. If traverser’s filter is null, then return FILTER_ACCEPT.
5. Set traverser’s is active to true.
6. Let result be the return value of call a user object’s operation
with traverser’s filter, "acceptNode", and « node ». If this throws
an exception, then set traverser’s is active to false and rethrow
the exception.
7. Set traverser’s is active to false.
8. Return result.

6.1. Interface NodeIterator

[Exposed=Window]
interface NodeIterator {
[SameObject] readonly attribute Node root;
readonly attribute Node referenceNode;
readonly attribute boolean pointerBeforeReferenceNode;
readonly attribute unsigned long whatToShow;
readonly attribute NodeFilter? filter;

Node? nextNode();
Node? previousNode();

undefined detach();
};

NodeIterator objects can be created using the createNodeIterator()
method on Document objects.

Each NodeIterator object has an associated iterator collection, which
is a collection rooted at the NodeIterator object’s root, whose filter
matches any node.

Each NodeIterator object also has an associated reference (a node) and
pointer before reference (a boolean).

As mentioned earlier, NodeIterator objects have an associated is
active, root, whatToShow, and filter as well.

The NodeIterator pre-remove steps given a NodeIterator object
nodeIterator and node toBeRemovedNode, are:
1. If toBeRemovedNode is not an inclusive ancestor of nodeIterator’s
reference, or toBeRemovedNode is nodeIterator’s root, then return.
2. If nodeIterator’s pointer before reference is true:
1. Let next be toBeRemovedNode’s first following node that is an
inclusive descendant of nodeIterator’s root and is not an
inclusive descendant of toBeRemovedNode, if there is such a
node; otherwise null.
2. If next is non-null, then set nodeIterator’s reference to next
and return.
3. Set nodeIterator’s pointer before reference to false.
3. Set nodeIterator’s reference to toBeRemovedNode’s parent, if
toBeRemovedNode’s previous sibling is null; otherwise to the
inclusive descendant of toBeRemovedNode’s previous sibling that
appears last in tree order.
__________________________________________________________________

The root getter steps are to return this’s root.

The referenceNode getter steps are to return this’s reference.

The pointerBeforeReferenceNode getter steps are to return this’s
pointer before reference.

The whatToShow getter steps are to return this’s whatToShow.

The filter getter steps are to return this’s filter.

To traverse, given a NodeIterator object iterator and "next" or
"previous" type:
1. Let node be iterator’s reference.
2. Let beforeNode be iterator’s pointer before reference.
3. While true:
1. If type is next":
1. If beforeNode is false, then set node to the first node
following node in iterator’s iterator collection. If
there is no such node, then return null.
2. If beforeNode is true, then set it to false.
2. Otherwise:
1. If beforeNode is true, then set node to the first node
preceding node in iterator’s iterator collection. If
there is no such node, then return null.
2. If beforeNode is false, then set it to true.
3. Let result be the result of filtering node within iterator.
4. If result is FILTER_ACCEPT, then break.
4. Set iterator’s reference to node.
5. Set iterator’s pointer before reference to beforeNode.
6. Return node.

The nextNode() method steps are to return the result of traversing with
this and "next".

The previousNode() method steps are to return the result of traversing
with this and "previous".

The detach() method steps are to do nothing. Its functionality
(disabling a NodeIterator object) was removed, but the method itself is
preserved for compatibility.

6.2. Interface TreeWalker

[Exposed=Window]
interface TreeWalker {
[SameObject] readonly attribute Node root;
readonly attribute unsigned long whatToShow;
readonly attribute NodeFilter? filter;
attribute Node currentNode;

Node? parentNode();
Node? firstChild();
Node? lastChild();
Node? previousSibling();
Node? nextSibling();
Node? previousNode();
Node? nextNode();
};

TreeWalker objects can be created using the createTreeWalker() method
on Document objects.

Each TreeWalker object has an associated current (a node).

As mentioned earlier TreeWalker objects have an associated root,
whatToShow, and filter as well.

The root getter steps are to return this’s root.

The whatToShow getter steps are to return this’s whatToShow.

The filter getter steps are to return this’s filter.

The currentNode getter steps are to return this’s current.

The currentNode setter steps are to set this’s current to the given
value.

1. Let node be this’s current.
2. While node is non-null and is not this’s root:
1. Set node to node’s parent.
2. If node is non-null and filtering node within this returns
FILTER_ACCEPT, then set this’s current to node and return
node.
3. Return null.

To traverse children, given a TreeWalker object walker and "first" or
"last" type:
1. Let node be walker’s current.
2. Set node to node’s first child if type is "first"; otherwise to
node’s last child.
3. While node is non-null:

otherwise node’s previous sibling.
2. If sibling is non-null, then set node to sibling and
break.
3. Let parent be node’s parent.
4. If parent is null, walker’s root, or walker’s current,
then return null.
5. Set node to parent.
4. Return null.

The firstChild() method steps are to traverse children with this and
"first".

The lastChild() method steps are to traverse children with this and
"last".

To traverse siblings, given a TreeWalker object walker and "next" or
"previous" type:
1. Let node be walker’s current.
2. If node is root, then return null.
3. While true:
1. Let sibling be node’s next sibling if type is "next";
otherwise node’s previous sibling.
2. While sibling is non-null:
1. Set node to sibling.
2. Let result be the result of filtering node within walker.
3. If result is FILTER_ACCEPT, then set walker’s current to
node and return node.
4. Set sibling to node’s first child if type is "next";
otherwise to node’s last child.
5. If result is FILTER_REJECT or sibling is null, then set
sibling to node’s next sibling if type is "next";
otherwise to node’s previous sibling.
3. Set node to node’s parent.
4. If node is null or walker’s root, then return null.
5. If the return value of filtering node within walker is
FILTER_ACCEPT, then return null.

The nextSibling() method steps are to traverse siblings with this and
"next".

The previousSibling() method steps are to traverse siblings with this
and "previous".

The previousNode() method steps are:
1. Let node be this’s current.
2. While node is not this’s root:
1. Let sibling be node’s previous sibling.
2. While sibling is non-null:
1. Set node to sibling.
2. Let result be the result of filtering node within this.
3. While result is not FILTER_REJECT and node has a child:
1. Set node to node’s last child.
2. Set result to the result of filtering node within
this.
4. If result is FILTER_ACCEPT, then set this’s current to
node and return node.

6.3. Interface NodeFilter

[Exposed=Window]
callback interface NodeFilter {
// Constants for acceptNode()
const unsigned short FILTER_ACCEPT = 1;
const unsigned short FILTER_REJECT = 2;
const unsigned short FILTER_SKIP = 3;

// Constants for whatToShow
const unsigned long SHOW_ALL = 0xFFFFFFFF;
const unsigned long SHOW_ELEMENT = 0x1;
const unsigned long SHOW_ATTRIBUTE = 0x2;
const unsigned long SHOW_TEXT = 0x4;
const unsigned long SHOW_CDATA_SECTION = 0x8;
const unsigned long SHOW_ENTITY_REFERENCE = 0x10; // legacy
const unsigned long SHOW_ENTITY = 0x20; // legacy
const unsigned long SHOW_PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION = 0x40;
const unsigned long SHOW_COMMENT = 0x80;
const unsigned long SHOW_DOCUMENT = 0x100;
const unsigned long SHOW_DOCUMENT_TYPE = 0x200;
const unsigned long SHOW_DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT = 0x400;
const unsigned long SHOW_NOTATION = 0x800; // legacy

unsigned short acceptNode(Node node);
};

NodeFilter objects can be used as filter for NodeIterator and
TreeWalker objects and also provide constants for their whatToShow
bitmask. A NodeFilter object is typically implemented as a JavaScript
function.

These constants can be used as filter return value:
* FILTER_ACCEPT (1);
* FILTER_REJECT (2);
* FILTER_SKIP (3).

These constants can be used for whatToShow:
* SHOW_ALL (4294967295, FFFFFFFF in hexadecimal);
* SHOW_ELEMENT (1);
* SHOW_ATTRIBUTE (2);
* SHOW_TEXT (4);
* SHOW_CDATA_SECTION (8);
* SHOW_PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION (64, 40 in hexadecimal);
* SHOW_COMMENT (128, 80 in hexadecimal);
* SHOW_DOCUMENT (256, 100 in hexadecimal);
* SHOW_DOCUMENT_TYPE (512, 200 in hexadecimal);
* SHOW_DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT (1024, 400 in hexadecimal).

7. Sets

Yes, the name DOMTokenList is an unfortunate legacy mishap.

7.1. Interface DOMTokenList

[Exposed=Window]
interface DOMTokenList {
readonly attribute unsigned long length;
getter DOMString? item(unsigned long index);
boolean contains(DOMString token);
[CEReactions] undefined add(DOMString... tokens);
[CEReactions] undefined remove(DOMString... tokens);
[CEReactions] boolean toggle(DOMString token, optional boolean force);
[CEReactions] boolean replace(DOMString token, DOMString newToken);
boolean supports(DOMString token);
[CEReactions] stringifier attribute DOMString value;
iterable<DOMString>;
};

A DOMTokenList object has an associated token set (a set), which is
initially empty.

A DOMTokenList object also has an associated element (an element) and
an attribute name (an attribute’s local name).

Specifications may define supported tokens for a DOMTokenList’s element
and attribute name.

A DOMTokenList object set’s validation steps for a given token are:
1. If set’s element and attribute name does not define supported
tokens, then throw a TypeError.
2. Let lowercaseToken be token, in ASCII lowercase.
3. If lowercaseToken is present in the supported tokens of set’s
element and attribute name, then return true.
4. Return false.

A DOMTokenList object set’s update steps are:
1. If get an attribute by namespace and local name given null, set’s
attribute name, and set’s element returns null and set’s token set
is empty, then return.
2. Set an attribute value given set’s element, set’s attribute name,
and the result of running the ordered set serializer for set’s
token set.

A DOMTokenList object set’s serialize steps are to return the result of
running get an attribute value given set’s element and set’s attribute
name.
__________________________________________________________________

A DOMTokenList object set has these attribute change steps for set’s
element:
1. If localName is set’s attribute name, namespace is null, and value
is null, then empty token set.
2. Otherwise, if localName is set’s attribute name and namespace is
null, then set set’s token set to value, parsed.

When a DOMTokenList object set is created:
1. Let element be set’s element.
2. Let attributeName be set’s attribute name.
3. Let value be the result of getting an attribute value given element
and attributeName.
4. Run the attribute change steps for element, attributeName, value,
value, and null.

tokenlist . length
Returns the number of tokens.

tokenlist . item(index)
tokenlist[index]
Returns the token with index index.

tokenlist . contains(token)
Returns true if token is present; otherwise false.

tokenlist . add(tokens…)
Adds all arguments passed, except those already present.

Throws a "SyntaxError" DOMException if one of the arguments is
the empty string.

Throws an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException if one of the
arguments contains any ASCII whitespace.

tokenlist . remove(tokens…)
Removes arguments passed, if they are present.

Throws a "SyntaxError" DOMException if one of the arguments is
the empty string.

Throws an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException if one of the
arguments contains any ASCII whitespace.

tokenlist . toggle(token [, force])
If force is not given, "toggles" token, removing it if it’s
present and adding it if it’s not present. If force is true,
adds token (same as add()). If force is false, removes token
(same as remove()).

Returns true if token is now present; otherwise false.

Throws a "SyntaxError" DOMException if token is empty.

Throws an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException if token contains
any spaces.

tokenlist . replace(token, newToken)
Replaces token with newToken.

Returns true if token was replaced with newToken; otherwise
false.

Throws a "SyntaxError" DOMException if one of the arguments is
the empty string.

Throws an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException if one of the
arguments contains any ASCII whitespace.

tokenlist . supports(token)
Returns true if token is in the associated attribute’s supported
tokens. Returns false otherwise.

Throws a TypeError if the associated attribute has no supported
tokens defined.

tokenlist . value
Returns the associated set as string.

Can be set, to change the associated attribute.

The length getter steps are to return this’s token set’s size.

The object’s supported property indices are the numbers in the range
zero to object’s token set’s size − 1, unless token set is empty, in
which case there are no supported property indices.

The item(index) method steps are:
1. If index is equal to or greater than this’s token set’s size, then
return null.
2. Return this’s token set[index].

The contains(token) method steps are to return true if this’s token
set[token] exists; otherwise false.

The add(tokens…) method steps are:
1. For each token of tokens:
1. If token is the empty string, then throw a "SyntaxError"
DOMException.
2. If token contains any ASCII whitespace, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
2. For each token of tokens: append token to this’s token set.
3. Run the update steps.

The remove(tokens…) method steps are:
1. For each token of tokens:
1. If token is the empty string, then throw a "SyntaxError"
DOMException.
2. If token contains any ASCII whitespace, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
2. For each token of tokens: remove token from this’s token set.
3. Run the update steps.

The toggle(token, force) method steps are:
1. If token is the empty string, then throw a "SyntaxError"
DOMException.
2. If token contains any ASCII whitespace, then throw an
"InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
3. If this’s token set[token] exists:
1. If force is either not given or is false, then remove token
from this’s token set, run the update steps and return false.
2. Return true.
4. Otherwise, if force not given or is true, append token to this’s
token set, run the update steps, and return true.
5. Return false.

The update steps are not always run for toggle() for web compatibility.

The replace(token, newToken) method steps are:
1. If either token or newToken is the empty string, then throw a
"SyntaxError" DOMException.
2. If either token or newToken contains any ASCII whitespace, then
throw an "InvalidCharacterError" DOMException.
3. If this’s token set does not contain token, then return false.
4. Replace token in this’s token set with newToken.
5. Run the update steps.
6. Return true.

The update steps are not always run for replace() for web
compatibility.

The supports(token) method steps are:
1. Let result be the return value of validation steps called with
token.
2. Return result.

The value getter steps are to return the result of running this’s
serialize steps.

The value setter steps are to set an attribute value for this’s element
using this’s attribute name and the given value.

8. XPath

DOM Level 3 XPath defined an API for evaluating XPath 1.0 expressions.
These APIs are widely implemented, but have not been maintained. The
interface definitions are maintained here so that they can be updated
when Web IDL changes. Complete definitions of these APIs remain
necessary and such work is tracked and can be contributed to in
whatwg/dom#67. [DOM-Level-3-XPath] [XPath] [WEBIDL]

8.1. Interface XPathResult

[Exposed=Window]
interface XPathResult {
const unsigned short ANY_TYPE = 0;
const unsigned short NUMBER_TYPE = 1;
const unsigned short STRING_TYPE = 2;
const unsigned short BOOLEAN_TYPE = 3;
const unsigned short UNORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE = 4;
const unsigned short ORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE = 5;
const unsigned short UNORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE = 6;
const unsigned short ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE = 7;
const unsigned short ANY_UNORDERED_NODE_TYPE = 8;
const unsigned short FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE = 9;

readonly attribute unsigned short resultType;
readonly attribute unrestricted double numberValue;
readonly attribute DOMString stringValue;
readonly attribute boolean booleanValue;
readonly attribute Node? singleNodeValue;
readonly attribute boolean invalidIteratorState;
readonly attribute unsigned long snapshotLength;

Node? iterateNext();
Node? snapshotItem(unsigned long index);
};

8.2. Interface XPathExpression

[Exposed=Window]
interface XPathExpression {
// XPathResult.ANY_TYPE = 0
XPathResult evaluate(Node contextNode, optional unsigned short type = 0, optio
nal XPathResult? result = null);
};

8.3. Mixin XPathEvaluatorBase

callback interface XPathNSResolver {
DOMString? lookupNamespaceURI(DOMString? prefix);
};

interface mixin XPathEvaluatorBase {
[NewObject] XPathExpression createExpression(DOMString expression, optional XP
athNSResolver? resolver = null);
Node createNSResolver(Node nodeResolver); // legacy
// XPathResult.ANY_TYPE = 0
XPathResult evaluate(DOMString expression, Node contextNode, optional XPathNSR
esolver? resolver = null, optional unsigned short type = 0, optional XPathResult
? result = null);
};
Document includes XPathEvaluatorBase;

The createNSResolver(nodeResolver) method steps are to return
nodeResolver.

This method exists only for historical reasons.

8.4. Interface XPathEvaluator

[Exposed=Window]
interface XPathEvaluator {
constructor();
};

XPathEvaluator includes XPathEvaluatorBase;

For historical reasons you can both construct XPathEvaluator and access
the same methods on Document.

9. XSLT

XSL Transformations (XSLT) is a language for transforming XML documents
into other XML documents. The APIs defined in this section have been
widely implemented, and are maintained here so that they can be updated
when Web IDL changes. Complete definitions of these APIs remain
necessary and such work is tracked and can be contributed to in
whatwg/dom#181. [XSLT]

9.1. Interface XSLTProcessor

[Exposed=Window]
interface XSLTProcessor {
constructor();
undefined importStylesheet(Node style);
[CEReactions] DocumentFragment transformToFragment(Node source, Document outpu
t);
[CEReactions] Document transformToDocument(Node source);
undefined setParameter([LegacyNullToEmptyString] DOMString namespaceURI, DOMSt
ring localName, any value);
any getParameter([LegacyNullToEmptyString] DOMString namespaceURI, DOMString l
ocalName);
undefined removeParameter([LegacyNullToEmptyString] DOMString namespaceURI, DO
MString localName);
undefined clearParameters();
undefined reset();
};

10. Security and privacy considerations
